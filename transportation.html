    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</h4>
    <p>It goes without saying that transportation, as an industry, has an enormous environmental impact. Assessments of the transportation sector’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions vary, but most sources indicate that it’s a minimum of 15%. The most grim figures are around 30%, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href='https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions' target='blank'>reporting</a> that transportation accounted for 28.9% of the country’s greenhouse gases in 2017. This includes cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes, and the toll on the environment is so high because more than 90% of the fuel used for American transportation is petroleum-based, primarily gasoline and diesel.</p>
    <p>The industry’s impacts are far-reaching: in addition to contributing to climate change, there is environmental degradation (to our water system, soil and land), pollution (that affects air quality and noise levels) and threats to biodiversity (due to land consumption and degradation). In looking at the central role that transportation plays in our daily lives, it is easy to see why the industry is such an important determinant of humanity’s carbon footprint.</p>
    <p>According to <a href='https://www.pollutionprobe.org/transport/' target='blank'>this video</a> produced by Pollution Probe and Student Energy, different methods of transportation move the world’s population a total of 81 trillion kilometres per year. (The video attributes 23% of all greenhouse gas emissions to the transport sector, and says that 95% of global transportation relies on petroleum.) The problem with petroleum-based fuel sources, is that in addition to generating energy for movement, they also generate greenhouse gases. Moreover, they are not always efficient: the average gas-fueled car is just 25% efficient, meaning that it uses 25% of its fuel for propulsion, while the other 75% is wasted or lost.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, alternative energy sources, such as biofuels and electric vehicles, are becoming more efficient and more widely used.  And, there are many options for getting around more sustainably.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, there are options for addressing this problem. Below are some helpful tidbits and tricks fore reducing waste generated by going out to eat.</p>
    <h4>Transportation</h4>
    <p>The best way to minimize your transportation-related environmental impact is to reduce your overall transportation. This applies not only to you, but also the goods that you use. For example, you can buy local food and products and telecommute as much as possible. You can also reduce the quantity of items you buy overall, which will automatically mean fewer miles travelled for your goods to get to you. This is particularly true in an era when home delivery is more popular than ever, for everything from Amazon orders to Uber Eats. Having these products shipped right to your door dramatically increases the distance they travel because each item has to make a special trip just for you, instead of being shipped to a central location, like a store or restaurant, as part of a larger order.</p>
    <h4>Sharing is Caring</h4>
    <p>When you do need to use a method of transportation, choosing low-impact options goes a long way. The best choices are those powered by you, such as walking, running, biking, rollerblading and skating. The next best choices are those powered by electricity and methods of transportation that you share, like electric vehicles and scooters or public transportation (or, even better, electrically-powered public transport!). The worst options are individual cars, and rides taken on ships and planes. While hard to avoid at times, use of these high-impact transportation methods can usually be minimized with a bit of advance planning. For example, if you have to rely on a car to get somewhere, consider carpooling to reduce the need for several vehicles to travel to the same destination.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, vehicle-sharing systems offers a great alternative to conventional car or bike ownership. Rather than paying a (relatively) large amount of money upfront to own a bicycle or car full-time, sharing programs – like Citi Bikes in New York City or BIXI in Montreal, and Car2Go in Canada or Zipcar in the U.S. – allow you to rent a car or bike on a short-term basis, usually for a low fee. Some programs offer membership plans, some operate on a pay-per-use basis and some use a combination of the two. Depending on your level of use, you could easily save thousands of dollars a year by not paying for all of the usual costs associated with car ownership, like finance payments, maintenance costs, licence fees, insurance premiums and parking fees.</p>
    <p>Affordable and convenient, these sharing systems offer access to transportation methods only when you need them, eliminating the need for a long-term commitment and encouraging users to be deliberate when they need to go somewhere. In the case of car-sharing programs in particular, they reduce the number of vehicles on the road at any given time, and therefore reduce car-related greenhouse gas emissions. Fewer cars also means less maintenance, which has its own environmental benefits, and as an added bonus the users can avoid the usual hassle of maintenance and repairs. Finally, car-sharing programs reduce the need for road infrastructure and parking, allowing for more green space in cities. For individuals and families who do not need a car on a daily basis, it’s worth looking into as an alternative to vehicle ownership.</p>
