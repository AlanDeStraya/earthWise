    <h3>Zero Waste Body</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Body Care Shopping</h4>
    <div class='zero-waste-sidebar'>
      <h4>The Zero-Waste Movement</h4>
      <p>A zero-waste lifestyle is, of course, about eliminating waste. The goal is to do so entirely, but it's often more pursued than achieved. The idea of producing absolutely no waste may sound daunting, but some easy lifestyle changes can drastically reduce a lot of waste generated each year.</p>
      <p>Bea Johnson is often called the founder of the zero-waste lifestyle movement, thanks to her book <a href='https://zerowastehome.com/' target='_blank'>Zero Waste Home.</a> Bea and her family generate a mere quart of waste per year. I particularly like their concept of the Five R’s. In order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refuse</strong> what you don't need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce</strong> what you do need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse</strong> by using reusables.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle</strong> what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Rot</strong> (compost) the rest.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See also my best zero-waste tips for <a href='#'>personal care</a>, <a href='#'>the home</a>, and while you’re <a href='#'>on the go</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The easiest place to eliminate waste is while shopping:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have access to a store that sells package-free personal care products, this is obviously the easiest way to reduce your waste. Zero-waste stores are becoming increasingly common, and they usually have a selection of skin, hair and body care products that you can bring home in your own, reusable container. Since zero-waste stores work with suppliers to eliminate waste in multiple ways (for example, ensuring that bulk shampoos and conditioners are shipped to the store in reusable containers, with minimal other packaging and/or packaging that is recycled and recyclable), customers are not only eliminating the waste of the single-use container each product is stored in, but also reducing waste at other points in the supply chain.</li>
      <li>If you do not have access to dedicated zero-waste store, you still may be able to buy zero-waste products from other environmentally conscious stores. Health food stores and bulk food stores (like Bulk Barn) sometimes sell personal care products without packaging, such as soaps and lotions, which you can put into your own reusable storage containers. Additionally, select eco-friendly retailers (like terra20 in Ottawa) sell shampoo, conditioner, body wash and other items in bulk, which are dispensed into their refillable bottles.</li>
      <li>DIY personal care products and cosmetics can be a great way to reduce waste. You can often buy ingredients in bulk from bulk food stores, using your own packaging, and store your creations in reusable containers. Health food or wellness stores are a great place to source DIY containers, like reusable spray bottles, dropper bottles, jars, tins and balm tubes. You can also order some of these things online, just be sure to consider the environmental impact of having your goods shipped directly to you.</li>
      <li>Mainstream retailers are also beginning to offer packaging-free options. Lush’s “naked” options include shampoo bars, solid conditioners, bath bombs, bar soap and more. According to <a href='https://www.lush.ca/en/discover/naked/' target='_blank'>Lush's website</a>: “35 percent of our products are packaging-free, or as we like to say, naked. These solid inventions are formulated with little to no water, meaning we’re also able to make them without any synthetic preservatives. It’s easy to reduce your plastic waste by choosing naked cosmetics like shampoo bars, solid conditioners, soaps, scrubs, massage bars and bath oils rather than buying their packaged counterpart. If you do prefer the packaged version, don’t fret—all our packaging is recycled, recyclable, reusable or compostable. Are you ready to go naked?”</li>
      <li>Finally, there are more and more options for products sold in recycled, recyclable, reusable and compostable packaging on the market. <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/' target='_blank'>TerraCycle</a> is an innovative, American recycling company that helps consumers deal with hard-to-recycle waste, like juice boxes, coffee capsules, plastic gloves and cigarette filters. Their website says that the company "offers free recycling programs funded by brands, manufacturers, and retailers around the world to help you collect and recycle your hard-to-recycle waste.” Consumers can choose which program(s) they want to join, collect their waste, download a free shipping label for their package, and send their waste to TerraCycle for it to be recycled responsibly. This company was founded in 2001 and has since become a global leader in collecting and repurposing waste, thanks in part to partnerships with major consumer brands, retailers and manufacturers, as well as municipalities and small businesses, in more than 20 countries. <a href='https://loopstore.com/' target='_blank'>Their newest project, Loop</a>, takes their waste-reduction efforts further by working with major companies (like Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever) to pilot a system of high-quality packaging that can be returned and refilled, repeatedly. Loop’s services are initially launching in France and New York and will hopefully be more widely available in the near future.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Specific Products and Alternatives</h4>
    <p>If you are new to zero-waste shopping and living, it can be hard to know what kinds of reusable products exist to replace their conventional, disposable counterparts. I find it is always helpful to know more about your options, whether you decide to transition to several of these alternatives at once, or prefer to gradually phase-out and replace your single-use items. Here is a list of products I have seen, purchased and/or used, to help you get started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer are much more easy to buy zero-waste, compared to liquid versions (I like <a href='https://www.lush.ca/en/discover/naked/' target='_blank'>Lush</a> for this, given the convenience of their locations and variety of their products)</li>
      <li>Reusable makeup pads or cloths made from cotton, bamboo or muslin (I prefer the simple route of a regular facecloth, but there are some examples of specific makeup removal products <a href='https://www.self.com/gallery/reusable-makeup-wipes' target='_blank'>here</a>)</li>
      <li>Menstrual cups (typically made of silicone) and reusable pads or liners (typically made of cotton) are great alternatives to single-use tampons, pads or liners, which are often bleached and made with plastic (I like the <a href='https://divacup.com/' target='_blank'>Diva cup</a>, which is widely available and often carried in mainstream pharmacies, but there are <a href='https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-menstrual-cup/' target='_blank'>many varieties</a> to choose from; there are also <a href='https://menstrualcupreviews.net/reusable-menstrual-cloth-pads/' target='_blank'>several options</a> for reusable pads, I like Tree Hugger because they are made in Canada and they plant a tree for every pad sold)</li>
      <li>Cloths and exfoliators made without plastic or with recycled plastic are eco-friendly alternatives to plastic-heavy loofahs (look for cloths, soap pouches and scrubbing pads made of hemp, natural loofah, silicone, agave or sisal, or recycled-plastic options like EcoTools’ Eco-Pouf)</li>
      <li>Reusable ear cleaners are a green alternative to single-use Q-tips (I use <a href='https://nu-grocery.myshopify.com/products/oriculi-reusable-ear-cleaner' target='_blank'>this bamboo ear cleaner</a> by Lamazuna, which is “designed to scoop out the ear wax that accumulates at the entrance of the ear canal”, but there are also a lot of spiral ear cleaners on the market that seem popular)</li>
      <li>Bamboo toothbrushes with nylon bristles, some of which even have replaceable heads (I like <a href='https://nu-grocery.myshopify.com/collections/beauty-hygiene/products/bamboo-toothbrush-travel-tube-from-brush-naked-2-pack' target='_blank'>this one from Brush Naked</a>, because it has its own travel bamboo case)</li>
      <li>Plastic-free dental floss can round out your eco-friendly dental hygiene routine, but beware that most options seem to be sold in a plastic case. Plus, the most common alternative to conventional nylon, which is derived from crude oil and takes upwards of 50 years to breakdown, appears to be silk — which requires that silk worms are boiled alive in the manufacturing process</li>
      <li>Long-lasting, durable razors (like <a href='https://nu-grocery.myshopify.com/collections/beauty-hygiene/products/safety-razor' target='_blank'>this one</a> made by German brand Merkur from chrome-plated steel)</li>
      <li>Post-consumer recycled toilet paper (such as <a href='https://www.pro.cascades.com/en/brand/cascades-pro-perform' target='_blank'>Cascades PRO Perform</a> line, which is certified by Green Seal, UL EcoLogo and Green-e)</li>
      <li>Handkerchiefs and reusable cloths towels are easy replacements for facial tissues and paper towels (Ökocreations sells a <a href='https://nu-grocery.myshopify.com/collections/beauty-hygiene/products/copy-of-pouch-for-reusable-pads' target='_blank'>pack of 4 handkerchiefs</a> made with unbleached, undyed 100% certified organic cotton satin, each of which is lined with a different colour so you can tell them apart)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to being more environmentally-friendly, many of these products will also save you money in the long-run. It’s a win-win!</p>
    <h4>Disposal</h4>
    <p>Unless you lead an entirely zero-waste lifestyle, you will likely have to dispose of old products or empty containers at one point or another. The best thing to do in these cases is to ensure that you are disposing responsibly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For personal care products that are still good, just no longer of use to you, see if they can be donated. Local shelters will sometimes accept toiletries and cosmetics, otherwise offering them to your neighbours for free can ensure they get used up (I use Freecycle, Kijiji and Bunz to give away things I no longer use). If the products cannot be re-homed or are expired, find out if your local disposal centre accepts cosmetics as household hazardous waste. Some municipalities will collect cosmetics, medications, aerosols, paints, fluorescent bulbs, batteries and other hazardous products at designated sites or times. If this is not an option, do one of the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>For bottles that can be completely emptied: remove as much of the contents as possible, putting the product into the trash where it will go into a landfill. Do not rinse out the bottle or pour the contents down the drain, as this will contaminate the water system</li>
        <li>For bottles that cannot be completely emptied: since these bottles cannot be recycled, put the entire bottle into the trash, where it will go into a landfill. Do not rinse out the bottle or try to pour the contents down the drain.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If your empty bottles or containers can be reused, give them a new life by filling them with personal care products you buy in bulk, or your own DIY creations. If you cannot or do not want to reuse them, you can try to give them away to someone who will reuse them. If that is not possible, find out which types of plastic and glass bottles are accepted through your city’s recycling system, or see if the product manufacturer has a recycling program of its own. For products that are not recyclable, see if <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-US' target='_blank'>TerraCycle</a> is available in your area. This unique, free waste-collection program is known to accept skin, hair and body care and cosmetics packaging, such as shampoo and conditioner bottles and caps, hairspray caps, lotion dispensers, gel tubes, lipstick cases, mascara tubes, compacts, palettes, foundation bottles, concealer tubes and eyeliner pencils. Note that donations of 10 lbs or more earn TerraCycle Points, which can be converted into donations to one of TerraCycle’s nominated charities or a non-profit of your choice.</li>
      <li>If you wear contact lenses, TerraCycle has a specific program for recycling both lenses and their packaging. Even though contact lenses are relatively small, they add up quickly: apparently, more than 290 million contacts end up in Canadian landfills or waterways every year. That’s why TerraCycle, in partnership with Bausch and Lomb, has initiated an <a href='https://www.bausch.ca/en-ca/every-contact-counts/' target='_blank'>“Every Contact Counts”</a> campaign, where contact lens users can visit a participating eye care professional to drop off discard lenses and blister packs for recycling.</li>
