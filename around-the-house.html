    <h3>Around the House</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Eco-Friendly Homes</h4>
    <p>We spend much, if not most, of our time at home, and having good systems in place to minimize our environmental impact can go a long way toward sustainable living. </p>
    <p>The tips below cover many different aspects of living EarthWise at home, such as where you live, what you live in, and things you find around the house. For information specifically related to clothing and apparel, see the <a href='https://www.liveearthwise.com/home/slow-fashion'>Slow Fashion page</a>.</p>
    <h4>Around the House</h4>
    <p>In general, the best ways to reduce your day-to-day waste are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carefully sourcing items that are eco-friendly (e.g., made of recycled or renewable materials, second-hand) and likely to last a long time.</li>
      <li>Taking care of your items to get as much use out of them as possible, and mending or repairing things when they break or wear down.</li>
      <li>Being creative with things that no longer have much use (to you or in general), like finding a new use or new home for them.</li>
      <li>Disposing of things correctly if they do stop working, so that the only things that go to a landfill are things that cannot be disposed of in any other way.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Below is what some of these tips look like in practice.</p>
    <h4>Eco-Friendly Furniture</h4>
    <p>When it comes to finding furniture that has a low environmental impact, there are three main things to look for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Furniture made from renewable materials, such as bamboo, cork, cotton and hemp. Supporting companies that use renewable materials and actively work to preserve the environment – for example, by planting trees every time a product is sold – is a win-win.</li>
      <li>Furniture made from reclaimed materials, such as wood, metal, glass and plastic. It is generally hard to find these options at large-scale stores, but custom-made furniture companies can often accommodate requests for items made from reclaimed materials.</li>
      <li>Furniture that is second-hand. Of course, buying previously-enjoyed items is arguably the most sustainable option we have. It gives pieces of furniture a new life, and keeps them out of landfills. Used items are also usually the most affordable, making it the easiest choice for our wallets as well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whichever route you decide to go, keep in mind that durability is also an important environmental consideration. The longer an item lasts, the less often it will need to be replaced, and the less likely it is to end up in the trash.</p>
    <h4>The "Upcycling" Trend</h4>
    <p>If you have never heard of upcycling, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upcycling' target='_blank'>definition on Wikipedia</a> is one of the best I have read: “Upcycling, also known as creative reuse, is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or for better environmental value.” This is in contrast to “downcycling”, which “involves converting materials and products into new materials of lesser quality.”</p>
    <p>Essentially, upcycling involves converting items of low use into items of higher use. There are all kinds of creative ideas out there, from craft blogs and Pinterest to entire magazines dedicated to upcycling. Here are a few of my favourite ideas to get you thinking about ways to make use of items that would otherwise go to waste:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/ZB6KYQBqyYwMf4rK8' target='_blank'>Serving platters</a>, <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/PXG8Sn2W5rPbybbY7' target='_blank'>vases</a> and <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/aA5NDZ61L6gboMSD6' target='_blank'>glasses</a> made from old wine or beer bottles</li>
      <li>Wall shelves made from <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/wQm2pvwWCWA2Wgrq7' target='_blank'>old books</a> or <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/37E8Jpq2M4aEqrPf7' target='_blank'>ladders</a></li>
      <li>Wall hooks made from <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/Uh7pgeS892eRxTQV8' target='_blank'>old silverware</a> or <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/qyo4sc8VHeG5Gnx2A' target='_blank'>tools</a></li>
      <li>Coffee tables or benches made from <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/qLevQpByx8NkY4ZD7' target='_blank'>old skateboards</a></li>
      <li>Planters made from <a href='https://images.app.goo.gl/GetDgFc5ZUHK2eBz7' target='_blank'>old, painted cans</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also upcycle items for others to use - for example, a friend told me that she has taken old clothing and textiles to her mechanic so that he can use the fabric to make rags for cleaning and such.</p>
    <p>The next time you are planning to dispose of an item, see if you can upcycle it instead!</p>
    <h4>Cleaning</h4>
    <p>There are plenty of ways to make household cleaning more environmentally friendly. Here are some easy ways to get started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wherever possible, wash laundry by hand instead of in a machine</li>
      <li>Dry laundered items using a line or drying rack instead of a machine</li>
      <li>Use natural and reusable products for cleaning (such as washcloths, sponges and brushes) made without plastic (try wood, bamboo, natural latex and rubber instead)</li>
      <li>Clean air with plants instead of air fresheners</li>
      <li>If you like to burn candles, choose eco-friendly ones (ideally made with vegetable-based oils or waxes, essential oils for fragrance, unbleached cotton wicks, and recycled/recycleable containers, such as recycled glass) </li>
      <li>Switching to better cleaning products (see below)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it comes to greener cleaning products, there are two options: purchasing more environmentally friendly commercial products, or making your own mixes at home:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Commercial products: Natural, eco-friendly product brands include Dr. Bronner, Ecover, Method, C is for Clean, Attitude, Aspen Clean, Seventh Generation, Simple Green, Eco-Max, Nellie’s and Green Works. Not all of these will meet a strict environmentalist’s criteria though, so be sure to read labels to check that the ingredients, packaging and recycling options align with your values.</li>
      <li>Make-your-own options: There are plenty of non-toxic, easy-to-find ingredients that you can use for cleaning at home. According to <a href='https://www.thespruce.com/tips-for-green-cleaning-1708700' target='_blank'>the Spruce</a>, a good DIY cleaning kit will include the following ingredients. For guidance on how to use these to clean different parts of your home, try <a href='https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/cleaning/tips/a24885/make-at-home-cleaners/' target='_blank'>Good Housekeeping</a>, <a href='https://greatist.com/health/27-chemical-free-products-diy-spring-cleaning' target='_blank'>Greatist</a>, or <a href='https://www.chatelaine.com/living/ultimate-guide-natural-cleaning-products/' target='_blank'>Chatelaine</a> for ideas.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Baking soda (aka sodium bicarbonate), a gritty scrubber that also reacts with acids like lemon and vinegar</li>
        <li>Borax, which disinfects, whitens and deodorizes</li>
        <li>White vinegar, which disinfects and loosens dirt</li>
        <li>Lemon juice, which disinfects and cuts through grease</li>
        <li>Olive oil, which picks up dirt and polishes wood</li>
        <li>Castile soap, an all-purpose foaming cleaner</li>
        <li>Washing soda (sodium carbonate), a caustic cleaner, stain remover and laundry supplement</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Building Supplies</h4>
    <p>The most eco-friendly option I have encountered for purchasing or donating home building supplies are Habitat for Humanity ReStores. These stores accept and resell quality new and used building materials, including windows, doors, paint, hardware, lumber, tools, lighting fixtures, furniture and appliances. As <a href='https://habitat.ca/restore' target='_blank'>their website</a> says, “Shopping at a Habitat ReStore is a socially conscious decision, as funds generated are used to fund local Habitat for Humanity homebuilding projects. It’s also an environmentally conscious decision, as much of what is sold is product that is new, gently used or customer returns that would otherwise end up in a landfill.” Find a <a href='https://habitat.ca/en/restore/find-a-restore-near-you' target='_blank'>store near you</a> or learn more about <a href='https://habitat.ca/en/restore/donate-to-a-restore' target='_blank'>donating items</a>.</p>
    <h4>Office Supplies</h4>
    <p>You may be surprised to learn that writing instruments and other office supplies can be recycled through select programs. TerraCycle, a unique social enterprise that operates in 20 countries to collect and recycle pre-consumer and post-consumer items that would otherwise go to landfill, offers a <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/zero_waste_boxes/office-supplies-en-ca' target='_blank'>Zero Waste Box for office supplies</a>. This box can be used to recycle any non-electronic items used in your office, such as as binders, calendars, labels, staplers, pens, pencils, hole punchers, and dividers. These boxes do need to be purchased, but all you have to do is order one, fill it up with materials that can be accepted, and mail it back to TerraCycle (it comes with a pre-paid, pre-affixed shipping label).</p>
    <p>If you are looking for an easier way to recycle writing instruments in particular, <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/brigades/staples-en-ca' target='_blank'>TerraCycle has partnered with Staples Canada</a> to offer consumers a free and convenient way to safely recycle used writing instruments. So the next time that a pen or marker dries out, don’t throw it away. Instead, bring it to one of the 300 Staples locations across Canada to make use of this great program. According to the TerraCycle website, “If all writing instruments recycled through this program were connected, they could travel up the CN tower nearly 700 times!”</p>
    <h4>Miscellaneous Items</h4>
    <p>If you are looking for more ways to recycle items around the house, these tips might be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crayons: To my knowledge, there are two options for recycling old crayon pieces. First, the <a href='https://www.crazycrayons.com/recycle-program' target='_blank'>National Crayon Recycle Program</a> in Colorado runs a Crazy Crayons program, which “takes unwanted, rejected, broken crayons to a better place, where they will be recycled into new crayons.” Second, <a href='https://thecrayoninitiative.org/collect' target='_blank'>The Crayon Initiative</a> in California  melts down old crayons and sends the new batch to children's hospitals across the country. Both organizations require that the sender covers the cost of shipping. If the crayons can still be used, consider donating them instead. The National Crayon Recycling Program suggests inner-city art programs, hospitals, orphanages, women’s shelters, homeless shelters, and low-income daycares.</li>
      <li>Markers: <a href='http://www.crayola.com/colorcycle' target='_blank'>Crayola accepts used markers</a> from school-wide recycling programs in the USA and parts of Canada. Learn more about how to sign up a school <a href='http://www.crayola.ca/about-us/green-initiatives/crayola-colorcycle.aspx' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
      <li>Eyewear: Again, there are two programs I have heard of: <a href='https://new-eyes.org/' target='_blank'>New Eyes</a> will send your glasses overseas with medical missions and international nonprofits (but note that you must pay for shipping, the cost of which is tax-deductible). There's also <a href='https://onesight.org/faqs/' target='_blank'>OneSight</a>, which recycles pairs of glasses and uses the proceeds to pay for a new pair of glasses for another patient. Participating LensCrafters and Pearle Vision stores will collect your old eyewear for this program.</li>
      <li>Contact lenses: Bausch + Lomb and TerraCycle offer a <a href='https://www.bausch.com/our-company/one-by-one-recycling' target='_blank'>contact lens recycling program</a>, which collects not only the lenses themselves but also the blister packs and top foil they are packaged in. Some optometrists or eye care centres have signed up for the program and will accept your discarded lenses and associated packaging, so it’s worth inquiring if any businesses within your region can recycle your lenses for you. Just be sure to comply with their collection requirements, which are usually that the items be in a sealed bag (like an old Ziploc-style bag), without any solution or the cardboard packaging your contacts came in (this can be recycled through your municipal program instead).</li>
      <li>Toothbrushes and other oral care items: TerraCycle and Colgate have collaborated to offer a <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/colgate' target='_blank'>free Oral Care Recycling Program</a> in the USA. Simply sign up, get your box in the mail, fill it with your old oral-care items — toothpaste tubes and caps, toothbrushes, toothpaste cartons, toothbrush outer packaging, and floss containers — print the shipping label and mail it in. TerraCycle will transform the waste into new products.</li>
      <li>Electronic waste: TerraCycle also offers a free program that recycles standard cell phones, smart phones, iPhones, select inkjet cartridges, laptops, notebooks, netbooks, and iPads. Learn more <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/zero_waste_boxes/e-waste-en-ca' target='_blank'>here</a>. You can also visit <a href='https://www.recyclemyelectronics.ca/' target='_blank'>RecycleMyElectronics.ca</a> to learn about the regulated recycling programs operated by the Electronic Products Recycling Association in nine provinces across Canada.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In Canada, TerraCycle has formed several other partnerships to help consumers recycle specific types of products. See <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/brigades' target='_blank'>this list</a> for the full range of free recycling programs, which includes <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/brigades/gillette-razor-recycling-program-ca-en' target='_blank'>razors and their packaging</a>, <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/brigades/brita-en-ca#@58.788243842484725:-103.77597021874999zoom:4' target='_blank'>Brita products and their packaging</a>, <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/brigades/toms-of-maine-en-ca' target='_blank'>natural care products by Tom’s of Maine</a>, and the plastic packaging and pouches from <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-CA/brigades/yves-veggie-cuisine-en-ca' target='_blank'>Yves Veggie Cuisine</a>, among other items.</p>
    <h4>Responsible Investing</h4>
    <p>If you are looking to invest responsibly, it can be difficult to know where to start. Thankfully, there are several guides and articles about how to invest in ways that align with, or at least do not contradict, your values, such as <a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-a-guide-to-socially-responsible-investing-and-how-to-get-started/' target='_blank'>this fairly detailed article from The Globe and Mail</a>. While it can take some time to understand the many options and approaches that exist and what will work best for you, there are three key things that are helpful for everyone to know: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, a few terms. Responsible investments tend to include “ESG” criteria or mandates, which stands for “Environmental, Social and Governance”.  As noted in <a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-a-guide-to-socially-responsible-investing-and-how-to-get-started/ target='_blank'>The Globe and Mail's guide to socially responsible investing</a>, there is no established definition for ESG, but it generally involves “promoting environmental sustainability and reducing a company’s carbon footprint; fostering social justice and responding to concerns of local communities; having an independent board of directors and a diverse management team; and consistently allocating capital effectively to the benefit of shareholders and stakeholders.” There is also “SRI”, for “Socially Responsible Investing”, and “RI” for “Responsible Investing”.</li>
      <li>Second, there are a variety of approaches to responsible investment. As <a href='https://www.agf.com/ca/en/insights/market-commentaries/articles/article-sustainable-investing-explained.jsp' target='_blank'>this article by AGF</a> explains, there are 5 main approaches, all of which aim to balance the desire for financial returns with an investor’s values:
        <ul>
          <li>Exclusions, where investment options are screened out of an investment portfolio because of certain criteria. For example, an investment portfolio that specifically excludes companies in the oil and gas industries for environmental reasons.</li>
          <li>ESG integration, where investment options are evaluated based on their performance on various environmental, social or governance issues. For example, a portfolio that can include oil and gas companies, but only if they have a clear and detailed plan to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
          <li>Shareholder engagement, where investors use their position as shareholders to encourage companies to act or behave in certain ways. For example, an investor who invests in oil and gas companies and actively participates in engagement opportunities, in order to urge the companies to develop clear and detailed plans to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
          <li>Thematic investing, where investors select investments based on particular areas of interest. For example, an investor who exclusively or primarily invests in green energy, like solar or wind.</li>
          <li>Impact investing, where investors select investments because of their ability to make a positive contribution to society. For example, an investor who invests in an energy company of any kind because it has a meaningful social or environmental program – like offering scholarships to low-income students to pursue studies in alternative or renewable energy technology.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Finally, there are different investment vehicles and management styles to choose from. Common vehicles include stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bonds, mutual funds, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), and high-interest bank accounts. ETFs are collections of stocks and bonds that are bought and sold as a package, much like an individual stock, and they are often a good choice for anyone who is risk-averse, new to investing (or not interested in managing individual investments), and not highly selective about their investments. There are already several ESG-themed ETFs to choose from. However, if you are more selective and/or comfortable managing individual stocks, it may be better to manually build an investment portfolio that reflects your values. It will not have the diversification that automatically comes with an ETF, but this option offers more control. In terms of management options, anyone not wishing to manage their own investment portfolio can hire a professional adviser or use one of the many so-called “robo advisers” that exist today. Professional advisers exist at regular banks and specific wealth management firms, some of which exclusively focus on responsible investing and some which offer SRI options, and usually have higher fees but offer more expertise and attention. Robo advisers, on the other hand, include wealth-management programs and apps, which usually have low fees but offer less customization and support. See <a href='https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/savings-investments/investing-basics.html' target='_blank'>this guide from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> for more information about investing options, concepts and considerations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Although the number of options to choose from can be confusing, the good news is that you can create a portfolio and strategy that reflects your specific priorities and prinicples.</p>
