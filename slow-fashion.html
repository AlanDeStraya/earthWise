    <h3>Slow Fashion</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>The Cost of Our Clothing</h4>
    <p>Though it is rarely talked about enough, the clothing and fashion industries have an enormous environmental impact. This is due in large part to the rise of "fast fashion", in which clothes are created to replicate catwalk trends and high-fashion designs, but are mass-produced and sold at a very low price point. It's highly profitable and completely unsustainable because consumers feel compelled to keep up with ever-changing designs and trends, buying and disposing of clothes at alarming speed. Relatively speaking, clothing has become very cheap. But it costs society in other ways, through the damage it does to our planet and the way it exploits workers.</p>
    <p>Consider these sobering facts:</p>
    <p><em>Production and consumption:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://unfccc.int/news/fashion-industry-un-pursue-climate-action-for-sustainable-development' target='_blank'>According to the UN</a>, textiles production is responsible for about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. The industry's emissions are projected to increase by as much as 60% by 2030.</li>
      <li>This $2.5 trillion-dollar industry is the <a href='https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/RCM_Website/RFSD_2018_Side_event_sustainable_fashion.pdf' target='_blank'>second highest user</a> of water worldwide, producing 20 percent of the world's water waste.</li>
      <li>The <a href='https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/one-garbage-truck-of-textiles-wasted-every-second-report-creates-vision-for-change' target='_blank'>Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a> reports that if nothing changes, by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget.</li>
      <li>It takes <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/01/numbers-economic-social-and-environmental-impacts-fast-fashion' target='_blank'>2,700 litres of water</a> to produce one cotton shirt, which is enough drinking water for someone for 2.5 years. Making a pair of jeans produces the same amount of GHGs as driving a car about 130 kilometres (or 80 miles). Producing <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/07/apparel-industrys-environmental-impact-6-graphics' target='_blank'>polyester</a> releases two to three times more carbon emissions than cotton, and polyester does not break down in the ocean.</li>
      <li>Clothing production <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula' target='_blank'>doubled</a> from 2000 to 2014 and the number of garments purchased per capita between 2000 and 2014 increased by about 60%. In fact, the number of garments produced annually exceeded 100 billion for the first time in 2014, which works out to nearly 14 items of clothing for every person on the planet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Disposal and pollution:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consumers keep clothing items about <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula#' target='_blank'>half as long</a> as they did 15 years ago. Consumers seem to treat the lowest-priced garments as nearly disposable, discarding them after just seven or eight wears.</li>
      <li>Clothing companies <a href='https://www.ft.com/content/f030f125-0a15-4097-bb5f-4b0543544ec3' target='_blank'>over-produce and over-buy</a>, because it is cheaper to double volumes with a factory and deal with the excess later. Their unsold merchandise is typically sent to landfill or incinerated, though some companies are trying to ensure excess stock is donated, recycled or sold at discounted prices.</li>
      <li>An astounding <a href='https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/RCM_Website/RFSD_2018_Side_event_sustainable_fashion.pdf' target='_blank'>85% of textiles</a> are sent to landfills. The equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles (about 2,625 kilograms) is landfilled or burned <a href='https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/one-garbage-truck-of-textiles-wasted-every-second-report-creates-vision-for-change' target='_blank'>every single second</a>. That's enough to fill 1.5 Empire State buildings each day. An estimated USD $500 billion value is lost every year due to clothing that’s barely worn and rarely recycled.</li>
      <li>Only about 25% of clothing collected for thrift shops actually sells in the stores, and 80-90% of donated clothing is not resold in Canada. Instead, <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/donated-clothing-where-it-ends-up-1.4662023' target='_blank'>a large portion of it</a> is exported to countries and regions around the world, many of which are developing economies, where it "suppresses the struggling textile industries in those countries and dumps our waste into their landfills." The rest is either cut down and repurposed as rags for industrial use, ground down and reprocessed for use as insulation or car-seat filling, or sent to landfill. This <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/donated-clothing-where-it-ends-up-1.4662023' target='_blank'>helpful graphic</a> breaks down what really happens to recycled clothing.</li>
      <li>Due to limited options, capacity and technology for recycling, the equivalent of 3 garments for every 5 produced ultimately end up in a landfill or incinerated <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula#' target='_blank'>each year</a>.</li>
      <li>The industry <a href='https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/one-garbage-truck-of-textiles-wasted-every-second-report-creates-vision-for-change' target='_blank'>generates a lot of pollution</a> too – when some clothes are washed, they release half a million tonnes of microfibres into the ocean every year, equivalent to more than 50 billion plastic bottles. <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/fast-fashion-environmental-impact-pollution-emissions-waste-water-2019-10#a-2017-report-from-the-international-union-for-conservation-of-nature-iucn-estimated-that-35-of-all-microplastics-very-small-pieces-of-plastic-that-never-biodegrade-in-the-ocean-came-from-the-laundering-of-synthetic-textiles-like-polyester-9' target='_blank'>These microplastics</a> are very small pieces of plastic that never biodegrade, and they make up about 35% of all microplastics in our oceans. Microplastics together comprise about 31% of all ocean pollution.</li>
      <li>Washing and drying 1 kilogram of clothing over its entire life cycle, using typical methods, generates an <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula#' target='_blank'>estimated 11 kilograms of greenhouse gases</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Human Rights Issues:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/RCM_Website/RFSD_2018_Side_event_sustainable_fashion.pdf' target='_blank'>1 in 6 people</a> in the world work in a fashion related job. It's well known that <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula#' target='_blank'>clothing-factory workers</a> are often underpaid and exposed to unsafe or deadly workplace conditions. Some <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/01/numbers-economic-social-and-environmental-impacts-fast-fashion' target='_blank'>clothing companies</a> also use child labour or forced labour, and most garment workers are women between the ages of 18 and 24.</li>
      <li>Dana Thomas, journalist and author of Fashionopolis: The Prices of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes, <a href='https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost' target='_blank'>explains</a>: "If a piece of clothing costs you $19.99, that means the person who made it was paid 19 cents."</li>
      <li>If consumption <a href='https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/RCM_Website/RFSD_2018_Side_event_sustainable_fashion.pdf' target='_blank'>continues</a> at its current rate, there will be three times as many natural resources needed by 2050 compared to what was used in 2000.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly, the fashion industry is rife with environmental and social issues, and clothes are very resource-intensive to produce, clean and dispose of. The good news is that we can reduce our personal impact by buying less and buying better.</p>
    <h4>Slow Fashion</h4>
    <p>In response to the prevalence of fast fashion, a sustainable clothing movement known as “slow fashion” has been born. Slow fashion is about a more mindful approach to clothing and apparel, focusing on designing, creating, and buying garments for both quality and longevity. By considering what it takes to produce our clothes, it prioritizes people and planet, encouraging better environmental and labour practices while also reducing waste.</p>
    <p>If you want to get a sense of how sustainable your wardrobe is, thredUP, the world’s largest consignment and thrift store, has created a neat <a href='https://www.thredup.com/fashionfootprint' target='_blank'>Fashion Footprint Calculator</a>. The short survey will assess your closet’s contribution to climate change, as part of thredUP’s commitment to saving the planet from fashion waste.</p>
    <p>The information on this page applies not only to clothing, but also to shoes and accessories as well as linens and other kinds of textiles. Below, I share my top tips for buying, caring for and eventually disposing of these items more sustainably.</p>
    <h5>Shopping Sustainably</h5>
    <p>Shopping for clothing used to be something that was done infrequently and only out of necessity – new clothes were purchased when we wore out or outgrew existing ones, or for very special occasions like weddings and other ceremonies.. Now, for many of us, shopping for clothing is a fun social activity, an easy way to combat boredom or pass time, and something we do often and without much thought.</p>
    <p>Part of this is because we are so far removed from most of our clothing's life cycle; it's often produced and disposed of in far away places. Another major cause is how artificially inexpensive fast fashion is: in many cases, clothing prices are the same as they were almost a century ago, <a href='https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20860620/fast-fashion-zara-hm-forever-21-boohoo-environment-cost' target='_blank'>during the Great Depression</a>. Despite ongoing inflation and the fact that things like food, vehicles and houses cost several times more than they did in the 1920s, we can still buy a piece of clothing (or sometimes an entire outfit) for just $19.99.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, there is reason to be optimistic. Some clothing companies are trying to do better, consumers are paying more attention to the societal impacts of their purchasing decisions, and documentaries like <a href='https://truecostmovie.com/' target='_blank'>The True Cost</a> are raising awareness about the human and environmental cost of fashion. There are now several ways to shop more sustainably, no matter your budget, so you can look and feel great. Here are my top 5 tips:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Buy less:</strong> A lot of people, myself included, are trying to move toward smaller wardrobes of items that we really like, commonly known as capsule wardrobes. Typically, a capsule wardrobe is made up of a small number of items that go together well to create a myriad of outfits, all of which fit properly, are timelessly stylish, will be worn often, and ideally make us feel good. There are so many benefits to having a smaller wardrobe:
        <ul>
          <li>It makes storage simple, meaning we do not need such large homes or closets to store large quantities of items we rarely or never wear.</li>
          <li>It means we spend less time and money shopping for clothes, cleaning and putting them away, and sorting through or clearing out our closets.</li>
          <li>Packing for trips becomes so much easier, and finding something to wear is a very straightforward process – because you love everything in your closet and can dress things up or down for the right occasion.</li>
          <li>Finally, this is an easy way to avoid the temptation of keeping up with ever-evolving fashion trends, and the endless collections or lines of clothing that companies now introduce each year. (Historically, companies offered two lines, based on the seasons – spring/summer and fall/winter; now, it’s common for stores to introduce between 6-24 lines in a single year to encourage consumers to shop year-round.)</li>
        </ul>
        If you’re not wearing something you already own very often, ask yourself if you really need or want to keep it. And if you're considering buying something new, make sure you think about your decision carefully and that you really love the piece before buying it; otherwise, it will just become clutter that prevents you from wearing something you like more, and will become something to re-home eventually. My personal system is to make sure that for every new item I buy, at least 1 item has to leave my closet. This forces me to think very carefully about how much I like something. My advice: if you’re in doubt, leave it out. You’ll save time and money, and eventually have a small, adaptable selection of clothes that you really enjoy wearing. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>Buy second-hand:</strong>As with other items, the most eco-friendly option is anything previously-enjoyed. Buying second-hand clothing, shoes, and accessories (as well as bedding, linens and towels) reduces the demand for new items, thereby reducing the need for new materials to be harvested or created. It also extends the life of resources already in existence and keeps still-useable items out of the landfill, or the incinerator. As <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/donated-clothing-where-it-ends-up-1.4662023' target='_blank'>this CBC article explains</a>, “charities and for-profits alike say a more lasting solution for people concerned about the fate of waste textiles would be to buy less stuff, or if they do buy, to buy more at thrift shops.” Depending on your personal values and what kinds of options are accessible to you, you can also try to prioritize shopping at thrift stores that you know try to sell locally as much as possible, rather than shipping goods off to foreign markets or landfills. Some charities, like the Society of St. Vincent De Paul, the Salvation Army and Goodwill, collect donated goods directly and sell them at their own thrift shops. Others, like Diabetes Canada and Big Brothers Big Sisters, sell the items they collect to for-profit enterprises such as Value Village, which then do the sorting and selling.</li>
      <li><strong>Buy well:</strong>If you prefer to buy new clothing and other items, or if you cannot find what you need second-hand, your best, most sustainable option is to buy well-made, responsibly-sourced items. First, you can try to choose clothes made from earth-friendly materials, such as organic cotton, linen, hemp and soy silk or cashmere (which are also kinder to animals than regular silk or cashmere). Second, you can support companies that are trying to <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/01/numbers-economic-social-and-environmental-impacts-fast-fashion' target='_blank'>change the way</a> we do fashion – by designing, testing and investing in production methods that reuse clothes and maximize their useful life. As noted by the <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/01/numbers-economic-social-and-environmental-impacts-fast-fashion' target='_blank'>World Resources Institute</a>, “Business models based on longevity, such as Rent the Runway and Gwynnie Bee, are the beginnings of an industry that supports reuse instead of rapid and irresponsible consumption.” Other companies, like H&M and Zara, are <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/07/apparel-industrys-environmental-impact-6-graphics' target='_blank'>pledging</a> to increase their clothing recycling by 2020 and are collecting and recycling used clothing at many of their stores, sometimes in <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula#' target='_blank'>partnership</a> with third parties like I:CO. (I:CO provides the collection bins, sorts the items so anything wearable can be sold, and recycles what is left.) Still others are working to use more <a href='https://www.roadmaptozero.com/?locale=en' target='_blank'>nontoxic, sustainable materials</a>, including responsible cotton through things like the <a href='https://bettercotton.org/' target='_blank'>Better Cotton Initiative</a>. Tools like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s Higg Index allows companies to measure the environmental, social and labour impacts of their products and services. And of course, companies have to <a href='https://www.wri.org/blog/2017/07/apparel-industrys-environmental-impact-6-graphics' target='_blank'>make less stuff</a>. One positive example of this is Patagonia’s Worn Wear program, which offers a service to fix old clothes rather than only sell new ones. There are <a href='https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/style-thats-sustainable-a-new-fast-fashion-formula#' target='_blank'>so many ways</a> in which clothing and apparel companies can address the social and environmental issues often involved with fast fashion, and we should support these initiatives wherever possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Rent special items:</strong> Companies that rent clothes, especially formalwear, are becoming more common – and for good reason. Renting clothes can allow us to save money and avoid buying things we are unlikely to wear again, while ensuring that high-end items like ballgowns and suits continue to be worn and enjoyed. It’s like borrowing a book from the local library, and it can be exciting to temporarily add an item to your wardrobe. </li>
      <li><strong>Swap and share:</strong> A lot of people now host and participate in clothing swaps, either at dedicated events or through apps like <a href='https://bunz.com/' target='_blank'>Bunz</a>. Swapping clothes with others your size is a great way to replace items you rarely wear with items you are excited about, without spending a dime or running the risk that your clothes will be sent to a landfill. Alternatively, consider sharing clothes with your family or friends. If a close friend is the same size as you and lives nearby, why not buy a few items together that you can take turns wearing? This is especially helpful for buying higher-end items like formal suits, and in situations where you are unlikely to need to attend the same events.</li>
