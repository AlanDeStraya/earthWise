    <h4>Zero Waste Home Tips</h4>

      <h4>The Zero-Waste Movement</h4>
      <p>A zero-waste lifestyle is, of course, about eliminating waste. The goal is to do so entirely, but it's often more pursued than achieved. The idea of producing absolutely no waste may sound daunting, but some easy lifestyle changes can drastically reduce a lot of waste generated each year.</p>
      <p>Bea Johnson is often called the founder of the zero-waste lifestyle movement, thanks to her book <a href='https://zerowastehome.com/' target='_blank'>Zero Waste Home.</a> Bea and her family generate a mere quart of waste per year. I particularly like their concept of the Five R’s. In order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refuse</strong> what you don't need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce</strong> what you do need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse</strong> by using reusables.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle</strong> what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Rot</strong> (compost) the rest.”</li>
      </ul>

    <p>The best way to live more sustainably is to live more minimally. Do away with what you do not really need, and focus on finding natural and environmentally friendly alternatives to the items that you do use regularly. You will save money, reduce clutter, decrease stress and enable yourself to focus more on more important things, like relationships and experiences. Plus, you will spend less time worrying about sorting, packing and storing your possessions when moving or travelling.</p>
    <p>These four tips will also help you to create less waste, enabling you to live with a smaller carbon footprint:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shop sustainably: Buying second-hand is generally the easiest way to be sustainable when shopping because it does not consume new resources or generate demand for new items, and it prevents items that are still usable from going to the landfill. It may be hard to find second-hand items that are also made of eco-friendly materials though, so eventual disposable may be more of an issue with second-hand items than those purchased new. If you do prefer to buy new items, choose ones made of eco-friendly materials. As noted on <a href='https://www.liveearthwise.com/home/around-the-house' target='_blank'>this page</a>, the most sustainable items are those made of materials that are already recycled or easy to renew or recycle.</li>
      <li>Stick to your list: To help you avoid buying things on impulse, create a list before you go shopping of things you know you need, and only permit yourself to buy things on that list. If you are anything like the average shopper, this will prevent a lot of unnecessary purchases, helping you to live more simply, intentionally and affordably.</li>
      <li>Rent, borrow or trade: There are also alternatives to buying items at all. Largely driven by the desire to be more eco-conscious, but also benefitting from the associated cost-savings, platforms like Ruckify and Bunz have become popular because they allow people to rent, borrow or trade items that they need. If you know you will only use certain items on rare occasions – for example, a pair of skis or a barbecue – it may be worth renting or borrowing these items when you need them, rather than owning them outright. In a similar vein, you may be able to trade away things you do not want or need for things you can use, which has similar benefits to shopping second-hand except that there’s no need for cash to exchange hands.</li>
      <li>Get creative: Whether you purchase something from a thrift store and want to make it your own, need to repair something that has broken or become worn, or are looking for a way to repurpose something that is no longer useful to you, you will likely need to be creative. Thankfully, it’s easy to find decor items second-hand, and the internet is bursting full of ideas for artistic crafts and upcycling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>In the Kitchen</h4>
    <p>There are several suggestions for achieving zero-waste for food on <a href='https://www.liveearthwise.com/food/zero-waste-tips' target='blank'>this page</a>, such as ideas for purchasing and storing food that do not involve single-use materials. Here are some additional ideas related to kitchen items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reusable straws: I like stainless steel ones, but have also seen ones made of glass, bamboo and other materials. Look for sets that come with a cleaning brush for easy cleaning.</li>
      <li>Silicone pastry and baking mats: These are a great alternative to parchment paper or aluminum foil that would ordinarily be used for baking things in the oven. They are food safe and non-stick, eliminating the need for oil or cooking sprays, easy to clean, and very durable.</li>
      <li>Silicone baking molds: An alternative to paper muffin cups that, like the baking mats mentioned above, removes the need for oils or cooking sprays. </li>
      <li>Silicone cooking utensils: Spoons, spatulas, and brushes made of silicone can replace those made from plastic or nylon, and will last a long time. </li>
      <li>Towels and cloths: These can replace single-use paper towels as well as dish sponges, which are usually made with plastic. I like to use a microfibre cloth on my counters, cotton towels for drying hands and dishes, and a dish cloth for doing dishes.</li>
      <li>Natural brushes and scrubbing pads: Rather than using plastic brushes and scrubbing pads to clean dishes, vegetables, fruit and kitchen surfaces, try brushes and scrubbing pads made from renewable and biodegradable materials like coconut, bamboo, wood and tampico.</li>
      <li>Natural dish detergent: There are all kinds of green options for liquid or powder dish detergent, for hand washing or the dishwasher. Try brands like Ecover, Seventh Generation, or Nellie’s, or try making your own (there are many DIY recipes and ideas online). </li>
      <li>White vinegar and baking soda: When mixed with warm water, these can make great, natural cleaning supplies that can often be purchased in bulk easily. Use vinegar and baking soda to wipe down counters, clean out your sink, soak dirty dish cloths and more. </li>
      <li>Compost bin: If your municipality does not offer a composting service, or if it does but you prefer to compost at home, it is probably worth investing in a compost bin. Bins made of stainless steel or ceramic seem to be the most popular, and ones with an airtight seal, vent and filter are probably going to be the least noticeable in your kitchen.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>In the Bathroom</h4>
    <p>Suggestions for zero-waste personal care covered <a href='https://www.liveearthwise.com/body/zero-waste-tips' target='_blank'>here</a>. Outside of this, these tips will help you to cut down your waste in the bathroom:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Natural cleaning supplies: Rather than cleaning your bathroom wish harsh chemicals, try more natural, environmentally-friendly products like those by Dr. Bronner, Ecover, C is for Clean, Attitude, Aspen Clean, Seventh Generation, Eco-Max, and Green Works. Round out your greener cleaning routine by using brushes made of natural materials, like wood or bamboo, and gloves made of natural latex and rubber.</li>
      <li>Towels and bath mats: Choose bath towels and mats made of natural fibres, like cotton or bamboo, over synthetic materials.</li>
      <li>Shower curtains: If you do not have a shower stall with a door, you do not have to rely on plastic shower curtains. Look for curtains made of natural linen, cotton or hemp. They will cost more upfront, but are more sustainable and will not off-gas the way that usual plastic shower curtains do.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>In the Bedroom</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Mattresses: These are typically among the hardest options to source sustainably. In recent years, more and more mattress companies have made claims about their products being eco-friendly, but it is hard to know whether these claims are genuine or if they are actually just greenwashing. In either case, if you do need to purchase a new mattress, your best bet is to find a mattress made of natural fibres (like latex foam), rather than synthetic ones, and to avoid products made with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (a common flame retardant also known as PBDEs). Products manufactured in Canada are also generally safer. Mattresses certified eco-friendly by a third-party are also more likely to actually be better for the environment, and your health.</li>
      <li>Bedding and linens: the best bedding and linens are those made from natural materials, such as cotton, linen, hemp and bamboo.</li>
      <li>Contraceptives and associated items: Most methods of preventing pregnancy or STIs have an environmental impact. <a href='https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/earth-friendly-sexy-times/' target='blank'>This helpful article</a> by Greenpeace provides the pros and cons of each.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>In Socializing and Play</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Children’s toys: More often than not, children’s toys are made of plastic. A greener option is toys made out of recycled, recyclable, and/or renewable materials. You don’t have to sacrifice quality or variety, as options available today include wooden building blocks and puzzles, dolls and figurines made of felt and cotton, organic and natural modelling clay and face paint, and toys made of recycled plastic.</li>
      <li>Junk mail: An easy way to reduce the amount of waste that enters your home is to refuse junk mail. A notice on your mailbox advising that you do not want to receive flyers or other unsolicited mail should be enough to cut this waste at the source.</li>
      <li>Freebies: As with the point above, it is important to avoid collecting unnecessary waste by saying no to things you do not ask for or need. When out and about, get into the habit of not picking up or accepting things like flyers, brochures, pamphlets, coupons, business cards and more that you are not likely to use.</li>
      <li>Gifts: Aside from choosing eco-friendly gifts for special occasions (or foregoing gifts altogether if you prefer), you can also choose eco-friendly ways to package them. Instead of using wrapping paper, gift bags, tissue paper, ribbons or bows, try wrapping your gifts in reusable items like cloths, handkerchiefs, jars or bottles. These can look very sweet and personalized in addition to being eco-friendly.</li>
      <li>Social gatherings: Trying to be zero-waste while socializing can be extremely tricky, especially if you are socializing with other people who do not share your commitment to waste reduction. I recommend having a gentle but frank conversation with people you socialize with often, to let them know about the changes you are making in your life, and why they matter to you. Be sure to make it clear that you are not judging other people for their choices or lifestyle decisions, but that you are requesting they adhere to yours. Explain what types of items or practices you are trying to avoid – such as ordering take-out or buying individually-wrapped packages of candy to give out at Halloween – and what you intend to do instead – like picking up food to go, in your reusable containers, and handing out candy that comes in aluminum foil, which is recyclable. Once your family and friends understand what you want to do, why and how they can help, it will be much easier to socialize with them without compromising your values.</li>
