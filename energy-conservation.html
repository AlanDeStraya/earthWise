    <h3>Energy Conservation</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Powering the Planet</h4>
    <p>The electricity required to power the lives of the entire global population is <a href='https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/world-power-consumption.htm' target='_blank'>estimated</a> to be about 15 terawatts, coming from all sources (oil, coal, natural gas, solar, wind, hydropower, biofuels, etc.). To put that into perspective, <a href='https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/world-power-consumption.htm' target='_blank'>howstuffworks explains</a> that just one terawatt could power about 10 billion 100-watt lightbulbs at the same time, given that most of the lightbulbs in our homes consume 100 watts of energy. Needless to say, humans use a lot of energy, not all of which is sustainable.</p>
    <p>It’s worth noting that there are major disparities in where the world’s energy is used. The howstuffworks article says the following, using data from the Worldwatch Institute:</p>
    <p>“Energy consumption is reportedly higher in countries where less than 5 percent of the population lives below the poverty line than it is in countries where most people live in poverty -- four times higher. For example, Americans make up­ less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet consume 26 percent of the world’s energy. Together, the United States and Canada account for 50 percent of energy consumed by the world’s richest industrialized countries; Europe, 33 percent. But the power landscape is changing. In the first half of 2003, auto sales in China grew 80 percent, and 4 million new privately owned cars hit the roads -- cars that will consume fossil-fuel energy.”</p>
    <p>The most commonly-used form of energy is oil, with nearly half of the world’s population relying on it as their primary power source. Next is natural gas, followed by combustible renewables and waste, coal, and finally alternative (more sustainable) power sources. Clearly, we need to do what we can to reduce our energy use and ensure that the energy we do use comes from clean, renewable sources. The scope of changes needed to protect the environment requires large-scale improvements at the national and global level, with industrialized countries cutting back on their energy use and developing countries adopting sustainable, renewable power sources as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>The bright side is that there are plenty of ways to reduce your energy consumption at home, ranging from simple good habits to how and where your home is built.</p>
    <h4>Energy Conservation</h4>
    <p>Many factors affect how much energy a home uses: how large it is, where it is located, what materials it is made of, and what kinds of appliances and other items are inside it. Obviously, day-to-day practices and habits are important here, and the following should become routine if it is not already:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Closely monitoring internal and external temperatures, or having automated settings for thermostats, since heating or cooling a home is very energy-intensive</li>
      <li>Getting into the habit of turning things off when they are not being used, such as lights, fans, screens and computers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these practices, we also need to consider the extent to which our homes themselves are sustainable and conducive to sustainable living. Many of the suggestions below focus specifically on energy use, but they are also connected to broader environmental savings that will go a long way towards reducing your carbon footprint.</p>
    <h4>Small Homes, Big Wins</h4>
    <p>Building and maintaining a home can be very resource-intensive. Although there does not seem to be an abundance of research in this area, <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/oct/14/carbon-footprint-house' target='_blank'>this article published in the Guardian</a> a few years ago reported that the environmental impact of constructing a new, two bedroom home would generate about 80 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. To put that into perspective, that’s the equivalent of roughly six years of living for the average resident of Britain, or 24 economy-class trips to Hong Kong from London. Of course, this will vary depending on the materials and methods used during construction, but you get the picture. The article did offer one piece of good news though: investing in sustainability improvements to existing homes requires less of an investment in terms of both financial cost and environmental impact, making it a highly practical option.</p>
    <p>Aside from refurbishing older homes to reduce their carbon footprint, we can also opt for homes that cost significantly less to construct in the first place. Enter the tiny home, which is dramatically smaller than its traditionally-sized counterpart, generally no larger than about 400 square feet. Unsurprisingly, tiny houses are highly efficient, <a href='https://www.chooseenergy.com/news/article/tiny-house-tinier-carbon-footprint/' target='_blank'>on several fronts</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Obviously, small houses use fewer building materials. While an ordinary house requires about seven truckloads of lumber, a tiny house <a href='https://greenliving.lovetoknow.com/low-impact-living/can-tiny-houses-help-environment' target='_blank'>requires half of one truckload</a>. This means fewer trees cut down for lumber, reduced use of metals and other materials, less fuel used in transporting materials, and more.</li>
      <li>According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average American home is more than 2,400 square feet and uses nearly 11,000 kWh of electricity per year. Tiny houses, meanwhile, require just a fraction of the electricity a traditional home would need for heating and cooling, because they are so compact. The difference is stark: on average, tiny houses produce 2000 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, compared to 28,000 pounds per year from a regular home.</li>
      <li>Tiny homes usually come with smaller versions of traditional home appliances, which means less electricity is being consumed by their refrigerators, dishwashers and laundry machines.</li>
      <li>Tiny houses are often self-powered, making use of solar panels or attached energy modules for electricity, which is more sustainable than using technology to improve efficiencies.</li>
      <li>In a smaller home, there are fewer items to replace: for example, a tiny house with just a single bathroom will have fewer fixtures to repair and replace over its lifetime. It’s <a href='https://digitalcommons.csbsju.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1034&context=elce_cscday' target='_blank'>estimated</a> that halving the size of a house reduces this "life cycle" cost by 36%.</li>
      <li>Finally, they encourage more simplistic and intentional living, automatically discouraging clutter and waste, which has its own sustainability benefits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly, tiny homes are a compelling option for anyone looking to reduce the environmental impact of their dwelling. However, if this option is not appealing or accessible to you, the main takeaway is still relevant: smaller homes are more sustainable.</p>
    <h4>Location, Location, Location</h4>
    <p>When deciding where to live, location is a huge factor. In addition to choosing where to live based on convenience (for example, proximity to offices, schools, shopping centres and activities) we can also take into account the environmental impact of travelling to and from the places we frequent. Long daily or weekly commutes are not only time-consuming, but also quite resource-intensive, especially when cars are involved. Living in a location that allows you to keep commuting to a minimum will also naturally keep your carbon footprint in check, so prioritize this wherever possible.</p>
    <h4>Building Materials and Renovations</h4>
    <p>Unsurprisingly, carefully choosing materials and equipment for construction, repairs and renovations can also improve your home’s sustainability. There are opportunities in almost every part of a home, from the flooring and lighting, to appliances and heating. Here are some ideas to keep in mind when constructing, renovating or remodelling your home, to minimize its energy use and improve its overall sustainability:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install energy-efficient appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines, dryers, dishwashers and air conditioning units (ideally certified by Energy Star). They will not only help the planet by using less energy, but they will help to reduce your electricity bill as well.</li>
      <li>Improve heating and efficiency by transitioning to more efficient home heating systems, such as geothermal systems or air source heat pumps, and improve insulation to prevent heat lost through walls and windows. You can also reduce the size of your water heater, or switch to an on-demand heating tank.</li>
      <li>Make use of natural and LED lighting. According to <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/19/10-ways-to-renovate-sustainably' target='_blank'>this article</a> from the Guardian, “Artificial lighting accounts for around 15% of the average domestic energy bill, but that figure could easily be reduced if you switched your lighting system from incandescent bulbs (which convert only 10% of electrical energy into light – the rest is wasted as heat) to LEDs. These require a comparably low amount of power, and are a much more sustainable source of artificial light. They work best with track and recessed lighting, and can last for up to 22 years.” You can also use carefully positioned mirrors and other reflective surfaces to make the most of natural light in rooms with windows.</li>
      <li>Wherever possible, use reclaimed materials. Purchasing reclaimed wood and metal is much more environmentally-friendly than buying newly-made items, and it will be cheaper too.</li>
      <li>If you can, deconstruct instead of demolishing. As <a href='https://greenhomeguide.com/know-how/article/remodel-your-home-sustainably' target='_blank'>this article</a> republished by the U.S. Green Building Council notes, “Demolition has an immense impact on the environment due to material waste. Before remodeling your home, think strategically about what to deconstruct and what items to keep. Thinking sustainably ahead of time can save you money by minimizing your long list of materials to buy and reduce waste. Walk through your home and see what you can re-use. Light fixtures, molding, cabinets, and even doors can be repurposed.”</li>
      <li>In the same line of thought, reface or refresh items that do not need to be fully replaced. The <a href='https://greenhomeguide.com/know-how/article/remodel-your-home-sustainably' target='_blank'>article</a> states, “Repurposing items and materials prevents unnecessary purchases for your home upgrades. Saving natural resources and reducing the emissions from the manufacturing and transportation of these materials does the environment a huge favour. Many green products and materials are also more durable and effective compared to non-sustainable products.</li>
      <li>When it comes to flooring, environmental consultancy <a href='https://eco-age.com/news/sustainable-home-renovations-step-step-guide' target='_blank'>Eco-Age recommends</a> prioritizing natural materials that are highly-durable: “Tiles that look stylish both indoors and outdoors are not only a versatile flooring option for home renovations, but are also a great solution for the eco-interior designer. Natural, high-quality stone tiles from sustainable quarries are arguably the most environmentally-friendly choice, as they will last for several years with little maintenance – meaning that your home will be sustainable for generations.” It is also <a href='https://greenhomeguide.com/know-how/article/remodel-your-home-sustainably' target='_blank'>reported that</a> natural linoleum lasts twice as long as vinyl flooring, reinforcing the idea that natural materials are a better choice that synthetic ones, on multiple levels.</li>
      <li>Although it’s not widely acknowledged, conventional wall paint can contain a lot of harmful chemicals. There are now eco-friendly paint options available on the market, which do not produce the harmful off-gassing from toxic chemicals and pollutants generated by most paints. Look for low- or no-VOC paints, which do not have chemical ingredients that evaporate into the atmosphere when the paint is drying.</li>
      <li>Lastly, consider how you dispose of leftover materials after construction or renovation. It is important to appropriately recycle everything you are left with, to the greatest possible extent, whether it is electrical materials, old carpet or flooring, excess paint or worn appliances. Find out what can be recycled through your municipality, and make arrangements for the rest as needed.</li>
