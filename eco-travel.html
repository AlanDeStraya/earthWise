    <h3>Eco-Travel</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>World Adventurer vs. Environmental Defender</h4>
    <p>For many people, myself included, travel is one of the greatest joys in life. It’s an incredible experience to be able to learn about a new part of the world first-hand. I love getting to know how people live and how other cultures differ from or are similar to my own – it’s an important part of being able to appreciate the vastness and beauty of the different regions and communities that make up the world.</p>
    <p>However, travel is almost inevitably very resource intensive, meaning it has a high impact on the planet. For example, consider that: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://www.dw.com/cda/en/to-fly-or-not-to-fly-the-environmental-cost-of-air-travel/a-42090155' target='blank'>According to Stefan Gössling</a>, a professor at Sweden's Lund and Linnaeus universities and co-editor of the book Climate Change and Aviation: Issues, Challenges and Solutions, “On an individual level, there is no other human activity that emits as much over such a short period of time as aviation, because it is so energy-intensive.” In fact, environmental group Germanwatch estimated that a single person taking one roundtrip flight from Germany to the Caribbean produces the same amount of damaging emissions as 80 average residents of Tanzania do in an entire year: around four metric tons of CO2. It is estimated that the aviation industry contributes <a href='http://thescienceexplorer.com/nature/it-s-time-wake-devastating-impact-flying-has-environment' target='blank'>about 2.5%</a> of total global CO2 emissions. However, <a href='https://www.dw.com/cda/en/to-fly-or-not-to-fly-the-environmental-cost-of-air-travel/a-42090155' target='blank'>aviation-related emissions</a> also include nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapor, particulates, contrails and cirrus changes, all of which have planetary warming effects.</li>
      <li>Cruises also raise serious environmental concerns. The cruising industry as a whole is known for its high environmental toll, due to its enormous fuel consumption, high levels of pollution, poor sewage treatment, and impacts on water quality and marine life. As <a href='https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/15/18096925/cruise-environment-pollution-crime' target='blank'>Vox</a> put it, “cruises are horrible for the environment: Their heavy and growing use of fossil fuels means someone on a seven-day cruise produces the same amount of emissions as they would during 18 days on land. And they can damage fragile ocean ecosystems, due to practices like irresponsible disposal of sewage.”</li>
      <li>Hotels have a high environmental toll as well, which makes sense when you think about their frequent turnover. Designed to be luxurious and indulgent, hotel rooms are not intended to be sustainable: they are filled with things like often-changed bedding and towels, miniature (and rarely fully used) toiletries, single-use coffee cups and cutlery, and lighting and appliances that may not be very efficient. In the United States alone, hotels create 1.9 billion pounds of waste (enough to fill 37 million suitcases), use 84.7 billion kwh of energy per year (enough to power 64.5 million TVs), and consume 219 billion gallons of water per year (enough for 1 person to shower non-stop for 277 years). They also generate 60 million tons of CO2 emissions annually, reports eco-traveller blog <a href='https://www.verdemode.com/2012/06/environmental-impact-hotels-future-green-infographic/' target='blank'>Verdemode</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In light of this, I sometimes feel like I have to choose between exploring the planet and protecting it, because to do one is to not do the other. But there are ways to make greener travel choices. Read on for tips and tricks to help you travel more sustainably.</p>
    <h4>Eco-Travel</h4>
    <p>Of course, the method of transportation we choose matters. Generally, ground transportation is the most environmentally-friendly option, especially in shared modes of transportation (like trains and buses). Cruises are easy to avoid, but if you find yourself unable to avoid a flight, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/climate/airplane-pollution-global-warming.html' target='blank'>this article from the New York Times</a> offers some suggestions for reducing the carbon footprint of your air travel. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy carbon offsets to counteract some of the damage caused by your flight. Some airlines offer the option to do this, but if yours does not you can always purchase offsets through other organization, where your money will go to activities like planting trees.</li>
      <li>Fly economy class, since the emissions generated by flying in business class are about three times as great as flying coach, according to a study by the World Bank.</li>
      <li>Fly direct if possible. The article explains: “The more times you take off, the more fuel you use. According to a 2010 report from NASA, about 25 percent of airplane emissions come from landing and taking off. That includes taxiing, which is the largest source of emissions in the landing-takeoff cycle.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interestingly, <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jun/15/theairlineindustry.ethicalliving' target='blank'>this article</a> in the Guardian reports that a study published in the journal Nature revealed that night-time flights are twice as bad for the environment as those that operate during the day. So, you may be able to easily reduce your impact on the planet by not flying at night.</p>
    <p>Finally, you might be surprised to learn that you can reduce flight’s footprint by travelling more lightly. Every single pound on an airplane matters and has a big impact on how much fuel the flight uses. While it may seem insignificant, minimizing what you bring on board will actually lighten your contribution to the flight’s emissions. Consider packing only what you truly need, choosing lighter-weight items (like a thin stainless steel water bottle instead of a glass one), and – no joke – using the airport’s bathroom just before you board.</p>
    <h4>Accommodations and Activities</h4>
    <p>The decision of where to stay during a trip can be dictated by several factors, although the majority of Canadians want to stay in green accommodations, according to a recent survey conducted by travel website Booking.com. <a href='https://globalnews.ca/news/4158911/sustainable-travel-canadians-booking-report-earth-day/' target='blank'>The survey</a> found that 84 per cent of Canadian travellers had a desire to “go green on future vacations”, and nearly half of all respondents said that “sustainable travel” means staying in eco-friendly accommodations. According to the article about the survey, the top sustainable vacation activities are as follows, with accommodations being a key consideration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buying locally made products instead of mass-produced tourist souvenirs (53%)</li>
      <li>Being adventurous and using public transportation instead of a taxi (52%)</li>
      <li>Going off the beaten trail to find a local restaurant that uses local ingredients (41%)</li>
      <li>Skipping tourist highlights in favour of less busy and often more rewarding sights (40%)</li>
      <li>Opting for a unique place to stay that is also a certified eco-accommodation over a traditional hotel (30%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly, eco-friendly accommodations are in-demand. Travel websites like Booking.com are therefore searching for ways to make it easier for consumers to achieve this goal, for example by highlighting more sustainable places to stay. In the meantime, look for hotels and resorts that make an effort to be sustainable. <a href='https://greensuitcasetravel.com/2018/08/eco-friendly-hotel/' target='blank'>This blog post</a> by Green Suitcase Travel offers 10 ways to tell whether or not a place is truly eco-friendly or sustainable:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The hotel has someone in charge of sustainability</li>
      <li>The hotel has eco-smart initiatives, such as recycling grey water</li>
      <li>The hotel leaves the surrounding land undeveloped or limits development to a minimum</li>
      <li>Their sustainability policies are clearly stated</li>
      <li>Energy and waste are properly managed</li>
      <li>The hotel supports the local community or a non-profit organization</li>
      <li>The hotel uses organics and/ or ethically sourced products (for their bathrooms, kitchen, cleaning, etc.)</li>
      <li>The hotel has a sustainable build (e.g., using recycled materials)</li>
      <li>The hotel is certified as sustainable or eco-friendly by groups like LEED and Green Key</li>
      <li>The hotel treats the staff well and pays fair wages</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The more information you can find about the above on a hotel or resort’s website, the more likely it is they are genuinely concerned about running an ethical, environmentally-friendly business.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Airbnb offers a great alternative if you prefer to avoid hotels and resorts. They are almost always more sustainable because they use far less energy and water, are usually equipped with longer-lasting items (like real dishes and silverware, and full-size toiletries), and they tend to generate less waste and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Airbnb issued a <a href='https://press.airbnb.com/how-the-airbnb-community-supports-environmentally-friendly-travel-worldwide/' target='blank'>press release</a> on this topic in 2018, the two main highlights of which are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“88 percent of Airbnb hosts around the world now incorporate green practices into hosting, such as using green cleaning products, providing recycling or composting, encouraging guests to use public transportation or providing bicycles, or installing solar panels.”</li>
      <li>“By staying in Airbnb listings rather than hotels in 2017, Airbnb guests in Europe achieved energy savings equal to that of 826,000 homes and reduced water usage equal to 13,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Airbnb guest stays in North America resulted in lower greenhouse gas emissions equal to that of over 354,000 cars and waste reduction of 64,000 tons.”</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Proactive Planning and Packing</h4>
    <p>Being organized when travelling is obviously beneficial on many levels, although you may be surprised to realize that planning ahead can not only reduce stress, but also the environmental impact of your trip. Preparing thoroughly for your trip can go a long way:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring that you have everything you think you will need during your trip will reduce the likelihood that you will need to hastily purchase emergency supplies or replacements for forgotten goods. This in turn will mean you are less likely to have to buy something that probably does not align with your values, such as a stick of deodorant that cannot be recycled or a disposable plastic razor that will only last a short time.</li>
      <li>Digitize your itinerary as much as possible to avoid wasting unnecessary paper. Wherever possible, choose electronic tickets, boarding passes and booking confirmations that you can display on a computer or smartphone. You can also say no to printed copies of maps and activity guides that may be offered to you while you are in transit, especially if there are digital alternatives.</li>
      <li>Travel with your own “sustainability kit” to reduce your reliance on single-use or otherwise wasteful items. For example, travelling with your own small bar of soap, for use in hotels or Airbnbs, will reduce the number of soap packages you have to open when you arrive and dispose of when you leave. You can also travel with a set of Tupperware and a reusable cutlery set, so that you can take food to go while travelling, without the need for wasteful, one-time packaging.</li>
    </ul>
