    <h3>Plant-Based for the Planet</h3>
    <img>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Plant-Based Popularity</h4>
    <p>The popularity of plant-based foods is at an all-time high. Record numbers of people are adopting plant-based diets around the world and restaurants and retailers are innovating to offer more plant-based menu options. Delicious alternatives to traditional meat, dairy and eggs are more widely available than ever before. The world is realizing the many benefits that come from eating more plants and fewer animal-based foods.</p>
    <p>There are several up-sides to plant-based diets: they are healthier for our bodies, more environmentally sustainable, often more affordable, and for many people they embody compassion and kindness. More and more people are choosing to eat plant-based for some or all of these reasons, knowing that their dietary choices have far-reaching consequences.</p>
    <p>A global shift towards plant-centric or plant-based diets has the potential to alleviate many of the most pressing issues we face today, from food insecurity and malnutrition, to climate change, antibiotic resistance and chronic illness. Consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diets high in plant-based foods are far more sustainable than diets high in animal products, as they require fewer natural resources (land, water, energy) to produce and emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
        <li>Plant-based diets are associated with lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, high blood pressure, and overall mortality.</li>
        <li>People who follow a plant-based diet spare up to as many as 200 animal lives per year.</li>
        <li>Plant-based diets can be highly affordable, costing as little as a few dollars per day and saving up to billions in annual health-care costs globally.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Plant-Based for the Planet</h4>
    <p>Anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist must, at some point, consider the environmental impact of their food choices. Meat, dairy and egg consumption has long been overlooked as an important factor in our carbon footprint, but there is now enough evidence that animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of environmental degradation that it can no longer be ignored.</p>
    <p>For example, we know that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Animal agriculture generates an estimated 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the second highest source of emissions and greater than all transportation (cars, trucks, planes, trains and ships) combined.</li>
        <li>The livestock industry uses about <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth' target='_blank'>83% of all farmland</a>, yet meat and dairy provide just 18% of all calories and 37% of all protein.</li>
        <li>Animal agriculture is also one of the leading causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water pollution, and has thus far directly caused the largest ocean ‘deadzone’ in the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
        <li>The meat and dairy industries are on track to be <a href='https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/meat-dairy-industry-greenhouse-gas-emissions-fossil-fuels-oil-pollution-iatp-grain-a8451871.html' target='_blank'>the world’s biggest contributors to climate change,</a> outpacing even the fossil fuel industry; the livestock sector could be responsible for 80 per cent of the allowable greenhouse gas budget by 2050.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For these reasons, experts around the world have pointed to plant-based diets as one of the most powerful ways to improve sustainability and mitigate climate change. In fact, the authors of the most comprehensive analysis of the food system’s impact on the environment to date found that a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet is <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown' target='_blank'>“essential” to avoiding a climate breakdown.</a> In practical terms, we need to consume 75% less beef, 90% less pork and half the number of eggs, while tripling consumption of beans and pulses and quadrupling nuts and seeds. </p>
    <p>Of course, not all ingredients that come from plants are automatically healthy and sustainable. Foods that travel a long distance to reach consumers (e.g., tropical fruits like avocados and bananas) are much worse for the planet than foods produced locally. And palm oil is an obvious example of a plant-based food product with a huge environmental toll: the huge demand for this ingredient, used in food products, personal care products, and as a cooking oil, is known for contributing to deforestation, displacing indigenous peoples, generating a lot of greenhouse gas emissions and driving several animal species toward extinction. However, as with most things in life, it’s about finding a balance between several imperfect options. In the case of palm oil, some argue that it is better than the alternatives – according to the <a href='https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/giving-up-palm-oil-might-actually-be-bad-environment-180958092/' target='_blank'>Smithsonian magazine,</a> oil palm plants yield significantly more oil per acre and require fewer pesticides and chemical fertilizers than coconut, corn or any other vegetable oil source. </p>
    <h4>Putting More Plants on Your Plate</h4>
    <p>Thankfully, it is easier than ever to include more plant-based foods in your diet. Whether you want to adopt a fully plant-based diet or simply eat more plant-based foods, there are meal ideas, recipes and products to suit your tastes and budget. Keep reading for tips for making the transition, recipes and resources I recommend, meal ideas and some of my favourite swaps for traditional animal products.</p>
    <h5>Tip 1: Know why you're doing it</h5>
    <p>There are many good reasons to reduce your meat, dairy and egg consumption, but knowing why it matters to you is important. There may be times when you fall back into old habits, and knowing what motivated you will help to remind yourself of why you made the decision to make a change in the first place. For me, knowing that about 70 billion land animals are killed for food each year worldwide – which is over 191 million animals per day or 133,000 animals per minute – was enough to make a permanent dietary change.</p>
    <h5>Tip 2: Decide on an approach</h5>
    <p>Some people stop eating all animal products overnight, while others opt for a more gradual approach. I personally became vegetarian first (a gradual process in itself, since I eliminated one type of meat from my diet at a time) then eventually became vegan after several months of cutting out all animal products and experimenting with new recipes. Do whatever feels right for you.</p>
    <h5>Tip 3: Look for alternatives to staples in your diet</h5>
    <p>If you consume a lot of animal products, you may want to find substitutions for your favourite items so that you can still enjoy foods you know you like. For example, there are some delicious and satisfying ‘faux meats’ (like those made by Gusta, Field Roast and Beyond Meat) and meat alternatives like soy, tempeh and seitan. These can usually replace meat in your favourite dishes and recipes, like pastas, stews, curries and salads. Non-dairy options abound, from milks made of nuts, seeds and grains, to plant-based yogurts, creamers, butter alternatives and ice cream. There are all kinds of substitutions for eggs in cooking and baking, and I have seen dozens of people won over by a tofu breakfast scramble. </p>
    <h5>Tip 4: Do your homework</h5>
    <p>As with any lifestyle change, it’s helpful to do a bit of research before diving in. A bit of reading can go a long way toward inspiring meal ideas, learning about plant-based nutrition, finding options for dining out and keeping track of ingredients that come from animals. You’ll want to carefully check labels for things like gelatin (found in marshmallows and gummy candies, for example), shellac (common in candies with a shiny coating), anchovies (in Worcestershire sauce and Caesar salad dressing), rennet (in some cheese/dairy products), carmine (used as a colouring agent), stearates (like calcium or magnesium stearate) or any derivatives of glycerine (like mono and di-glycerides, which are found in most commercial bread products). Some of these ingredients can be derived from plant-source, but unless it is specified on the label you should probably assume otherwise. </p>
    <h5>Tip 5: Talk to your friends and family about your decision</h5>
    <p>I recommend this for two reasons, especially if you are making the switch to an entirely plant-based diet. First, the topic will inevitably come up in conversation anyway, and loved ones will likely want to know the reason for the change and how it will affect them. It’s generally a good idea to talk about how to manage the transition – for example, you may need to be a little more involved in planning the menu for your next family gathering, or you could offer to prepare something the next time you go over to a friend’s house. Second, friends and family can be an important source of support in your new lifestyle, and may even decide to join you in your journey. They can help you to stay motivated and have fun along the way.</p>
    <h5>Tip 6: Pay attention to your body</h5>
    <p>Most people seem to feel great after ditching meat, dairy and eggs from their diet: they report increased energy, easier digestion, deeper sleep and better mood, as well as a clearer conscience if your new diet better aligns with your values. However, it’s important to make sure you’re eating balanced meals and getting the right nutrients (this goes for everyone, regardless of how they eat). If you start to notice any negative changes that don’t clear up on their own, like low energy levels or significant weight loss, it may be worth seeing a doctor or nutritionist. Eating a variety of fresh, whole foods should leave you feeling strong and healthy, but you may need or choose to supplement your diet with extra doses of vitamins and minerals like iron, B12 and calcium.</p>
    <h4>Plant-Powered Menus</h4>
    <p>Here are some meal ideas to help you get started. I also encourage you to visit the <a href='/recipes.html'>Recipes page</a> for more inspiration! </p>
    <h5>Breakfast</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Baked oatmeal: make it with oatmeal and non-dairy milk and whatever mix-ins you like: fruit, a sweetener (I like maple syrup), cinnamon or nuts.</li>
      <li>Overnight oatmeal: simply combine oats with your choice of mix-ins (I like walnuts, chia seeds and cinnamon) with some non-dairy milk and a pinch of sweetener, soak overnight in your fridge and enjoy cold in the morning.</li>
      <li>French toast: mash up a banana with some non-dairy milk and cinnamon, dip your bread in the banana mixture, and cook as you would prepare regular French toast. For a banana-free option, use ground chia or flax seeds instead.</li>
      <li>Smoothies: blend up your favourite fruit with some greens and your choice of liquid, and add in some seeds, protein powder or non-dairy yogurt to make it a meal. My go-to mixture is 1 frozen banana blended with 1 tbsp hemp seeds, 1 tbsp chia seeds, 1 large handful spinach or kale, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 scoop of plant-based protein powder, blended with water and ice until smooth. </li>
      <li>Smoothie bowls: simply prepare a smoothie of your choice, pour it into a bowl and top with fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, shredded coconut or whatever else you like.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Lunches and Dinners</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Pasta: try a tomato-based sauce like marinara, a yellow “cheese” sauce (made of potatoes, carrots, olive oil, nutritional yeast and spices), an Alfredo sauce made from cashews, a dairy-free pesto, or a primavera with olive oil and herbs. Add in some veggies and lentils, beans or meat replacement (try a ground beef alternative, plant-based meatballs, or texturized vegetable protein), and you’re set. Spiralized or grated zucchini makes a great raw pasta dish.</li>
      <li>Soups and stews: there are all kinds of delicious options here, like <a href='#'>cream of broccoli soup,</a> potato and leek soup, <a href='#'>curried sweet potato, carrot and coconut soup,</a> <a href='#'>three bean and lentil stew,</a> and hearty Irish stews.</li>
      <li>Curries: a lot of dishes from India, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and elsewhere are already plant-based. There are plenty of options that make use of lentils, chickpeas, spinach, eggplant, potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage and more to choose from. Enjoy with brown rice or quinoa for a healthy and protein-packed meal. </li>
      <li>Bowls and salads: I love creating colourful and healthy meals by mixing greens and grains with vegetables, beans or legumes or lentils, and my favourite toppings and dressing. My all-time favourite is a big bowl of spring mix or spinach with roasted sweet potato, baked tofu, diced tomato, chopped red onion, avocado, sunflower seeds and dried cranberries, with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. A close second would be a mixture of my favourite roasted vegetables, brown rice, pan-seared tofu and a spicy peanut sauce made of natural peanut butter, soy sauce, hot sauce, lime or lemon juice and some non-dairy milk to thin.</li>
      <li>Burgers and dogs: pre-made veggie burgers and hot dogs can make a simple, satisfying meal when you’re short on time, or looking for something easy to make while camping or at a barbecue. Or if you have the time, you can make them yourself; there are all kinds of recipes online for great options like black-bean burgers, southwest sweet potato burgers, white bean and sun-dried tomato burgers, and more.</li>
      <li>Tacos, burritos, quesadillas and nachos: you can make plant-based versions of your favourite Mexican dishes by swapping beans or a lentil-walnut mixture for the meat and non-dairy cheese and sour cream for the dairy-based versions. Sautéed vegetables, guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo and fresh lime and cilantro will add flavour and help to round out the meal.</li>
      <li>Stuffed peppers and loaded baked potatoes: who doesn’t love a big, roasted pepper stuffed with rice, beans, spices and non-dairy cheese? Or a fluffy baked potato loaded with a mix of plant-based toppings? For some inspiration, see my recipe for <a href='#'>loaded baked sweet potatoes.</a></li>
      <li>Fresh spring rolls: for a healthy, light meal or snack, roll sliced vegetables, tofu and rice noodles into a rice paper wrap, dip in a spicy peanut sauce or sweet chilli sauce, and enjoy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Snacks</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Trail mix: buy it ready-made or mix your favourite dried fruits, nuts and seeds together for your own unique mix.</li>
      <li>Rice cakes: top them with nut butter and jam or hummus and sliced tomato, for a sweet or savoury snack.</li>
      <li>Sticks and dips: veggie sticks with a plant-based dip, like hummus or mayonnaise-free baba ganouj makes a healthy snack, or try an apple, banana or celery sticks with peanut or almond butter, if you’re craving something sweeter. </li>
      <li>Popcorn: there are few snacks I love more than air-popped popcorn drizzled with non-dairy butter or coconut oil, topped with sea salt and nutritional yeast. Yum!</li>
      <li>Dark chocolate: most people are surprised to learn that a lot of dark chocolate (especially ones made with 60% cocoa or more) are often dairy-free. Simply check the label to make sure there is no milk, and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Desserts</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Ice cream: there are now many different non-dairy ice cream options on the market, from indulgent options from Ben & Jerry’s and Haagen-Dazs, to low-calorie treats like Halo Top, and low-cost options like Breyer’s. </li>
      <li>Cookies and bars: most conventional products at grocery stores and bakeries are made with animal products, but it is slowly becoming easier to find plant-based options when shopping or dining out. It’s also quite easy to bake with plant-based ingredients, and the internet is full of fantastic recipes you can make at home. </li>
      <li>Cakes and pies: some ready-made options are free of milk and eggs, like some fruit-based pies from regular grocery stores. Specialty and health-food stores are more likely to have a wider variety of options. My personal favourite is the chocolate cake from Whole Foods; it’s simple but delicious, and many people who have tried it cannot tell it’s plant-based.</li>
      <li>Other sweet fixes: if I’m at home and craving something sweet after dinner, I’ll often melt a spoonful of chocolate chips in a bowl with some peanut butter, stir it up and eat it with a banana. Otherwise dried fruit (for example dates, raisins, apples, pineapple, cranberries) are a nice, healthy way to satisfy a sweet tooth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Deciphering Food Labels</h4>
    <p>In addition to eating more plant-based, there are other ways to make more sustainable and ethical food choices. In my experience, there are six broad categories of things to consider based on how foods are produced and packaged: whether an item is organic, the labour standards it was produced under, its method(s) of production, any environmental certifications, its nutritional claims and its packaging. Unfortunately, these considerations may not overlap – for example, a product may be grown organically, but wrapped in plastic destined for a landfill. Similarly, higher animal-welfare products like grass-fed meats are not automatically better for the environment. With so much to consider, it can be difficult to be an educated and informed consumer. My suggestion is to just try to learn as much as you can and do your best to eat in line with your values, and know that as consumer demand for more sustainable options increases, it will get easier.</p>
    <h5>Organic Certifications</h5>
    <p>Generally, organic standards vary by country and are regulated by a government authority and/or other certification body. Within Canada, any food products that are labelled organic are regulated by the <a href='https://www.inspection.gc.ca/organic-products/regulating/eng/1328082717777/1328082783032' target='_blank'>Canadian Food Inspection Agency</a> (CFIA), and some provinces also have provincial organic requirements. If a CFIA accredited certification body certifies that a product meets the Canadian Organic Standards, that product can be certified organic.</p>
    <p><a href='https://www.inspection.gc.ca/organic-products/standards/eng/1300368619837/1300368673172' target='_blank'>These standards</a> apply to the types of substances and practices that can be used in food production – for example, the kinds of pesticides or inputs in crop agriculture, or how animals should be housed and cared for. It’s hard to say exactly how much better organic products are for the environment, but in general organic products are designed to minimize adverse impacts on the planet while also following higher standards for things like animal welfare. Since they are more heavily regulated than non-organic products, and it can take quite a lot of time and work to become certified organic, it seems more likely that companies producing certified organic products are actually adhering to better practices (rather than just greenwashing, as some companies do).</p>
    <p>Of course, products that are labelled organic but are not certified may not be truly organic, so be wary. At the same time, products may be produced in line with most organic standards (say, without the use of certain substances, like synthetic pesticides), but not be labelled organic because they have not been certified. A great example is local produce at a farmer’s market – farmers will sometimes follow organic practices but do not have the resources to be certified. If you have the opportunity, ask your local vendors or farmers about their environmental practices to learn more.</p>
    <p>If you are outside of Canada, I recommend looking into your country or region’s organic regulations, if they exist. Otherwise, any organic products you come across should include the name of the certifying body and the standards they follow, so you can do more research on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <h5>Labour Certifications</h5>
    <p>For anyone concerned about the labour conditions in which an item was produced, there are a few certification schemes that mandate specific standards and practices. The most common ones I have seen for products in Canada are Fairtrade International, Fair Trade USA and the Rainforest Alliance, and each has its own distinct logo. For more information about fair trade certification programs and organizations, see the <a href='https://fairworldproject.org/get-informed/movements/fair-trade/certifiers-membership-orgs/' target='_blank'>Fair World Project’s</a> assessment of each program for its comprehensiveness and enforcement (note: they rate Fairtrade International as the best of these options).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://www.fairtrade.net/' target='_blank'>Fairtrade International</a> is an independent, third party certification system for goods that are produced in developing countries, which strives to “ensure better prices, decent working conditions and fair terms of trade and to support local sustainability for farmers and workers”. They certify things like fresh fruit, coffee and tea, cocoa, sugar, flowers, rice, nuts and spices.</li>
      <li>Fairtrade is distinct from <a href='https://www.fairtradecertified.org/business' target='_blank'>Fair Trade USA,</a> which is also primarily focused on improving conditions for “farmers, workers, their families, and their communities around the world.” They advocate responsible business and conscious consumerism, with the goal of eliminating poverty, ensuring safe working conditions, and protecting the environment. In addition to certifying food, they also certify clothing, home goods and personal care products.</li>
      <li><a href='https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/' target='_blank'>Rainforest Alliance</a> certifies products that promote “ecosystem health, human rights, and improved rural livelihoods”. They use three sets of standards – the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard (fresh fruit, flowers, household items, personal care products, rubber and more), the UTZ Code of Conduct (coffee, tea, cocoa and hazelnuts), and the Ethical Biotrade (UEBT) standard (spices).</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Method-of-Production Labels</h5>
    <p>Method-of-production labels typically refer to practices designed to improve environmental sustainability, health, animal welfare or social justice. Most common are food items bearing labels such as “homemade” and “natural”; “grass fed” or “vegetarian fed” meat; “free run”, “free range”, or “cage free” meat and eggs; “raised without hormones” or “raised without antibiotics” animal products; and “solar-powered production”, “made with recycled materials” or “100% post-consumer recycled content”, which may refer to the product or its packaging.</p>
    <p>Unless any of these claims are part of a certification scheme, they are likely not audited or independently verified, though they may be subject to marketing and labelling regulations that intend to prevent false advertising. Additionally, they should be taken at face value – we should not assume that an item with one claim, such as a “raised without antibiotics” promise, is good for the environment or animal welfare. If any of these types of labels are important to you, focus on finding products that align with your values and try to ensure they are legitimate wherever possible (e.g., verified through a certification scheme, or consistent with the ingredient list).</p>
    <h5>Environmental Impact Labels</h5>
    <p>These types of labels are relatively new, but some companies are beginning to show the overall environmental impact of their products. One example is Unilever, which announced plans to put carbon impact labels on each of its 70,000 products as part of the company’s overall sustainability plan to be carbon neutral by 2039. The labels will show “how much greenhouse gas was emitted in the process of manufacturing and shipping them to consumers”, according to <a href='https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/unilever-s-new-climate-plan-puts-carbon-labels-on-70-000-products-1.1450409' target='_blank'>this article in Bloomberg.</a></p>
    <p>These kinds of labels could be a powerful tool to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions, and to motivate companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible. As they become more common, it will be important to consider how they calculate environmental impact and whether or not the measurements are truly inclusive, capturing the full impact over a product’s entire life cycle.</p>
    <h5>Nutrition Labels</h5>
    <p>Obviously, most food items also advertise their nutritional properties – most commonly in the form of nutrition information tables, but also sometimes through descriptive claims about their health benefits. These could include things like “Omega-3 enriched” and “calcium fortified”, which are generally clear and easy to verify by looking at the ingredient list or nutrition table, or “multigrain” or “no added sugar”, which can be misleading.</p>
    <p>None of this is directly linked to sustainability, but consumers sometimes tend to assume that if a product boasts these kinds of seemingly-positive attributes, it may be a better product overall. For example, that Omega-3 enriched eggs are also more likely to be produced in a more environmentally-friendly way. While logical in theory, this typically does not hold true in actual practice. Do not assume anything about a product that is not specifically stated somewhere on the label, and read labels carefully to try to determine whether or not any stated claims – health or otherwise – are accurate.</p>
    <h5>Packaging</h5>
    <p>Finally, environmentally-minded consumers can look for labels indicating how sustainable an item’s packaging is. For example, some packages will note that they are made of “100% recycled” materials, like cardboard, paper, glass or plastic. It’s worth noting that something can be made of pre-consumer (aka post-industrial) or post-consumer recycled materials, which, unsurprisingly, indicates whether the content comes from manufacturer waste that never actually made it to the consumer or was repurposed after being used by a consumer.</p>
    <p>As explained in more <a href='https://www.treehugger.com/whats-the-difference-between-pre-and-post-consumer-recycled-content-4863933' target='_blank'>detail by Treehugger here,</a> both are good but the latter is more likely to be better for the environment, so look for post-consumer recycled content wherever possible. If an item just says it is made of “recycled” materials, without specifying if they are pre-consumer/post-industrial or post-consumer, it could be made of either, or a combination of the two. Since a company is likely to want to highlight its sustainability efforts though, I would assume anything that only says “recycled” is mostly or primarily made of repurposed pre-consumer waste.</p>
    <p>In addition to checking if an item is recycled, eco-conscious shoppers can also check an items recyclability – that is, its ability to be recycled after it is disposed. Items that are recyclable will sometimes say so directly (for example, “recyclable where facilities exist”), but most often they will include the universally-recognized recycling symbol (three “chasing arrows” that form a triangle), leaving the consumer to determine if an item can be recycled in their region. A common misconception is that the recycling symbol means an item is automatically recyclable; in reality, the symbol and number inside it (also known as a plastic resin code) only tell us what type of material the item is made from.</p>
    <p>The Plastic Action Centre has a <a href='https://plasticactioncentre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Infographic-3-1400x5641.png' target='_blank'>fantastic infographic</a> that explains each of the 7 plastic resin recycling codes mean, how recyclable each type of plastic is and what it can typically be recycled into. As they note <a href='https://plasticactioncentre.ca/directory/plastic-by-the-numbers/' target='_blank'>on their website:</a> “Plastics that have #1 (PETE) or #2 (HDPE) are the most commonly recycled plastics. Plastics #3, #4, #5, #6 and #7 are generally tougher to recycle and are not universally collected in local recycling programs.”</p>
    <p>Here’s a quick reference guide that will help you know which plastics to avoid and re-use, if you have to use plastic (see <a href='https://learn.eartheasy.com/articles/plastics-by-the-numbers/' target='_blank'>eartheasy’s website</a> for more detailed information):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plastic #1: Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET or PETE) – highly recyclable; most commonly used in single-use plastic bottles; should be recycled but not reused because of the potential to allow bacterial growth, as it is hard to decontaminate, and the potential to leach carcinogens.</li>
      <li>Plastic #2: High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) – highly recyclable; most commonly used in hard plastic jugs and bottles, some toys and bags; very durable, can be cleaned and reused.</li>
      <li>Plastic #3: Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) – not recyclable; most commonly used in food wrapping and bottles, blister packaging, and toys; contains numerous toxins and can leach them throughout its entire life cycle; can be repurposed but not for anything involving food, or for use by children.</li>
      <li>Plastic #4: Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) – not commonly recyclable, but it depends on your region; most commonly used in single-use grocery bags, food packaging bags and squeezable bottles; considered safer/less toxic than some other plastics, and can be reused.</li>
      <li>Plastic #5: Polypropylene (PP) – often recyclable; most commonly used in cereal bags and other food packaging, plastic bottle tops, disposable diapers and straws; can be safely used.</li>
      <li>Plastic #6: Polystyrene (PS) ­– not commonly recyclable; most commonly used in Styrofoam cups, containers, cartons and packaging; may leach styrene, a possible human carcinogen, into food products (especially when heated in a microwave); should not and cannot be reused, due to structural weaknesses and potential health impacts. Avoid where possible.</li>
      <li>Plastic #7: Other Plastics – includes BPA, Polycarbonate and LEXAN, so recyclability varies; most commonly used in baby bottles, water cooler bottles and car parts; there is a risk that polycarbonate containers made using BPA (Bisphenol A) will leach chemicals into food or drink products; generally not safe to reuse (unless they say PLA/compostable as well). Avoid where possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly, whether or not an item can be recycled depends on your region’s waste processing capabilities. In Canada, waste and recycling programs are managed by each municipality, so what is recyclable in one city may not be recyclable in another. Unfortunately, this puts a lot of onus on consumers to investigate what items are made of and how to dispose of them responsibly. Thankfully, some municipalities have tried to make this easier on consumers – the City of Ottawa has a <a href='https://ottawa.ca/en/garbage-and-recycling/recycling' target='_blank'>detailed recycling guide</a> and <a href='https://app06.ottawa.ca/cgi-bin/search/recycle/q.pl?q=&lang=en' target='_blank'>searchable “Waste Explorer”</a> to help individuals determine what to do with their waste. Of course, the simplest way to go is to avoid packaging and disposable items whenever possible.</p>
