    <h3>Natural Products</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>The Best Self Care</h4>
    <p>Conventional personal care products are generally not very good for us. They are often made with harsh chemicals and preservatives, which can be very harmful to our bodies, and they are generally packaged in single-use containers, which are definitely not good for the environment. Many also contain environmentally-degrading ingredients like palm oil, which causes extensive deforestation in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia and is threatening the lives of species like endangered Sumatran orangutans. </p>
    <p>Major environmental organizations, such as <a href='https://environmentaldefence.ca/campaign/toxics/' target='_blank'>Environmental Defence</a> and the <a href='https://davidsuzuki.org/science-learning-centre-article/whats-inside-counts-survey-toxic-ingredients-cosmetics/' target='_blank'>David Suzuki Foundation</a>, have called for stronger federal regulations and significant reductions in the use of toxic chemicals in personal care products, to better protect human health and the environment. According to the David Suzuki Foundation’s <a href='https://davidsuzuki.org/science-learning-centre-article/executive-summary-whats-inside-counts-survey-toxic-ingredients-cosmetics/' target='_blank'>“What’s Inside? That Counts” report</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a 2010 study in which 6,200 Canadians provided data for more than 12,500 personal care products, almost 80% of products reportedly contained at least one of the Dirty Dozen ingredients (12 sets of chemicals linked to health and environmental concerns, including cancer, reproductive disorders, asthma and severe allergies). Alarmingly, participants were unable to locate ingredient lists on more than 1,000 products.</li>
      <li>Canada’s lax cosmetic ingredient labelling requirements lead to incomplete ingredient lists on many products. For example, product manufacturers are not required to disclose specific fragrance ingredients and can use the generic term “parfum” instead, which may represent several dozen chemicals. </li>
      <li>Furthermore, in Canada, personal care products that are considered to be “drugs” because of their therapeutic claims (e.g., tartar-fighting toothpaste, bacteria-killing cleansers, face cream with sun protection) are not subject to the cosmetic ingredient labelling requirements. </li>
      <li>U.S. researchers have identified a total of 10,500 industrial chemicals that are used as cosmetic ingredients, including carcinogens, pesticides, reproductive toxics, endocrine disruptors, plasticizers, degreasers and surfactants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Natural products are a much better choice: they have cleaner ingredients, better for both people and the planet, and they are often made to be more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for information, tips and tricks for making healthier and more sustainable choices when it comes to personal care.</p>
    <h4>Natural Products</h4>
    <p>Of course, not every product labelled as “natural” is automatically good for us. The growing interest in cleaner, greener products has been accompanied by an upward trend in instances of “greenwashing”, where companies or products pretend to be more green than they actually are. Verify that “natural” and “organic” claims actually mean something by looking for certifications and the absence of the worst ingredients.</p>
    <p>According to <a href='https://environmentaldefence.ca/reports-guides/guide-the-toxic-ten-pocket-guide/' target='_blank'>Environmental Defence</a>, these are the top ten most toxic ingredients to watch out for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Triclosan</li>
      <li>Artificial musk</li>
      <li>Phthalates</li>
      <li>Petrolatum</li>
      <li>Formaldehyde releasing agents: quaternium-15, diazolidinyl urea</li>
      <li>Parabens</li>
      <li>1,4-dioxane, contaminant in sodium laureth sulfate (SLS)</li>
      <li>Silicone chemicals: cyclomethicone, cyclotetrasiloxane, cyclopentasiloxane, cyclohexasiloxane</li>
      <li>Coal tar-derived colours (p-phenylenediamine and colours listed as “CI” followed by a five digit number)</li>
      <li>BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) & BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <a href='https://davidsuzuki.org/queen-of-green/dirty-dozen-cosmetic-chemicals-avoid/' target='_blank'>David Suzuki Foundation</a> also adds these ingredients to the list of harmful ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DEA-related ingredients</li>
      <li>Dibutyl phthalate</li>
      <li>Parfum (a.k.a. fragrance)</li>
      <li>PEG compounds</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Credible Certifications</h4>
    <p>As a general rule, products that are certified as organic or natural are a safe bet. Here are some common certifications to look for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://cosmos-standard.org/' target='_blank'>COSMOS</a>: Originating in Belgium, this newer labeling standard is intended to replace Ecocert and some other standards, and indicates at least 95% certified organic ingredients, as well as the absence of GMO ingredients, officially endangered ingredients and animal testing or ingredients.</li>
      <li><a href='https://www.ecocert.com/en/' target='_blank'>ECOCERT</a>: This European certification denotes both natural and organic products, both of which must have 95% or more ingredients of "natural origin", and is one of the largest organic certification organizations in the world.</li>
      <li><a href='http://www.natrue.org/' target='_blank'>NATRUE</a>: This certification by the International Natural and Organic Cosmetics Association denotes both natural and organic products, which must have “95% of natural ingredients stemming from controlled organic production and/or controlled wild collection” and must not include GMO ingredients.</li>
      <li><a href='https://www.npanational.org/certifications/' target='_blank'>Natural Products Association Certified</a>: The NPA Standard and Certification for personal care products indicates a product is at least 95% naturally-derived, excluding water. It encompasses all cosmetic personal care products regulated and defined by the American Food and Drug Administration.</li>
      <li><a href='https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Cosmetics-Body%20Care%20Products.pdf' target='_blank'>USDA Organic</a>: Regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture, this certification requires a product to have at least 95% organic ingredients. Plus, personal care products must meet the same standards as food products, meaning that they are technically edible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Smarter Shopping</h4>
    <p>Locating better products is easier than ever: in addition to being available at most specialty health food stores, they are increasingly available at traditional drug stores and supermarkets, and via a variety of online retailers. Of course, whenever possible it’s great to support businesses that are local and/or dedicated to stocking quality products, but since that is not always an option it’s good to know that many mainstream businesses are now stocking higher-quality personal care items.</p>
    <p>Here are some reputable, responsible brands to look out for. Though this is by no means an exhaustive list, it can help you get started in exploring cleaner, more natural products. Just be sure to check individual product labels for ingredients and certifications, since not every product made by the companies below is as healthy and sustainable as it could be.</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Contraceptives</h4>
    <p>While it is becoming easier than ever to find environmentally-friendly product options for hair care, skin care, makeup and more, one area that can still be challenging is contraception. Although the number of more sustainable and socially-conscious birth control methods available has certainly increased in the past decade or two, all methods still seem to involve a bit of a compromise:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Condoms: Single-use, latex-based condoms are of course not very environmentally-friendly, though their impact on the planet can vary depending on where the rubber from the latex is sourced from, what other ingredients they are made with, and how they are disposed of. The good news is that better brands do exist – such as <a href='https://www.sustainnatural.com/products/condoms' target='_blank'>Sustain</a>, <a href='https://einhorn.my/einhorn-condoms/' target='_blank'>Einhorn</a>, and <a href='https://www.glydeamerica.com/'>Glyde</a> – and there are ways to recycle the packaging, through film plastic recycling programs like <a href='https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/rb-health#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4' target='_blank'>TerraCycle</a>. Latex is generally a better option than polyurethane, which is petroleum-based and never breaks down, and ingredient nonoxynol-9 should be avoided at all costs because it can increase the risk of disease transmission. Whichever option you go for, do not flush a condom down the toilet, as this can be incredibly harmful to waste management systems, waterways, fish and other animals, and the condom itself will never biodegrade. <a href='https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/are-condoms-eco-friendly-other-green-safe-sex-questions/' target='_blank'>This article</a> provides a more in-depth overview of condoms specifically.</li>
      <li>Intrauterine devices (IUDs): These are a much longer-lasting option, staying in the uterus for between 5-10 years. They are typically made from plastic or copper-wrapped plastic, either of which have to be disposed of eventually, but on the whole, IUDs are a more sustainable choice that are also very effective. Certain IUDs may also lighten your menstrual flow, which is great from an environmental perspective because it can be difficult to wear a reusable menstrual cup if you have an IUD. However, they are a bit more “intrusive” and may not be right for every body.</li>
      <li>Hormonal options (pills, rings, patches, and more): Like IUDs, these are a bit more intrusive – they can affect much more than a person’s fertility, and can have long-lasting effects. Depending on the method in question though, they are generally less wasteful than individually-wrapped, single-use items like condoms. However, one environmental risk associated with birth control pills and the like is that their synthetic hormones, especially estrogen, can make their way into our wastewater system and eventually our waterways, harming fish and other aquatic animals. Hormonal contraception is certainly not the only source of estrogen in our waters, but it is apparently quite difficult to remove. Hormonal options also tend to involve a lot of packaging, although continuous cycle birth control pills have the added benefit of reducing the need for feminine hygiene products to be used every month. Patches, meanwhile, generate less waste because they only need to be replaced once per week, but they also release more hormones into the bloodstream than regular pills, which could cause health problems like blood clots.</li>
      <li>Diaphragms, sponges, and caps: These methods generally create less waste than the pill, but they do not last as long as IUDs and need to be replaced much more frequently. They also often need to be accompanied by spermicides, which generate additional packaging waste. It is also worth noting that these methods generally not as effective at preventing pregnancies than the methods above.</li>
      <li>Family planning or fertility awareness methods: This is arguably the most eco-friendly option, since there are no products and no waste involved, but it does come at a price. Not only is it typically less effective than the methods described above (approximately 90-93% when tracked carefully, compared to up to 99% for condoms and IUDs), but it also requires more awareness and effort from the people using it. Thankfully, several apps and devices (such as special thermometers or apps like <a href='https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/how-to-use-clue-if-youre-on-the-hormonal-birth-control-pill' target='_blank'>Clue</a> and <a href='https://www.naturalcycles.com/' target='_blank'>Natural Cycles</a>) have simplified the process, making it much easier and more reliable.</li>
      <li>Sterilization: Finally, there are the more permanent solutions of vasectomies and tubal ligations, for anyone who is sure that they do not want to become pregnant. Sterilization is of course low-waste, but as with some of the other options, it is not right for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, I suggest this <a href='https://ecoreactor.org/en/eco-friendly-contraception/' target='_blank'>more detailed article from ecoreactor</a>. While it is nearly impossible to be completely zero-waste when it comes to preventing unplanned pregnancy, there are two positive things worth keeping in mind: first, the growing interest in sustainable living among consumers should mean that more options become available in the near future; and second, that family planning in itself is the environmentally-friendly option, since large families obviously have large carbon footprints. </p>
    <h4>Additional Information and Resources</h4>
    <p>For more information about specific brands and products, Ecoholic Body by Adria Vasil contains detailed information about the health and environmental concerns associated with personal care products (including things like perfume and colognes, as well as contraceptives), in addition to helpful product reviews. <a href='https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/' target='_blank'>Environmental Working Group’s “Skin Deep” Cosmetics Database</a> is also a great tool, created to house “online profiles for cosmetics and personal care products and their potential hazards and health concerns” so that consumers can make better, more informed choices.</p>
