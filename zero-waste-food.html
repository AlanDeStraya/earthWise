    <h4>Zero Waste Food Tips</h4>
    <div class='zero-waste-sidebar'>
      <h4>The Zero-Waste Movement</h4>
      <p>A zero-waste lifestyle is, of course, about eliminating waste. The goal is to do so entirely, but it's often more pursued than achieved. The idea of producing absolutely no waste may sound daunting, but some easy lifestyle changes can drastically reduce a lot of waste generated each year.</p>
      <p>Bea Johnson is often called the founder of the zero-waste lifestyle movement, thanks to her book <a href='https://zerowastehome.com/' target='_blank'>Zero Waste Home.</a> Bea and her family generate a mere quart of waste per year. I particularly like their concept of the Five R’s. In order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refuse</strong> what you don't need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce</strong> what you do need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse</strong> by using reusables.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle</strong> what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Rot</strong> (compost) the rest.”</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <h5>Food Shopping</h5>
    <p>For me, one of the biggest sources of household waste comes from food items that are sold in single-use packaging. Here are my suggestions for reducing the amount of plastic and aluminum that comes into your home.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Above all else, it is important to be equipped with a few zero-waste essentials: things like Tupperware, jars, bottles, reusable baggies and reusable produce bags will help you to do your shopping without relying on single-use packaging. I invested in a few useful items, like reusable produce mags, a <a href='https://www.stasherbag.com/' target='_blank'>stasher bag</a>, and some shopping totes, but almost anything will do. I have a collection of assorted jars and bottles from things I previously bought that were stored in glass, and I use them for everything — beans, lentils, pasta, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, nut butters, sauces, popcorn kernels, tea, coffee, spices, you name it! These, combined with some regular food storage containers, mean that I can always find something the right shape and size to hold whatever I need to buy.</li>
      <li>Buying in bulk is a great way to eliminate packaging waste. If you have access to a bulk food store, or a regular or specialty store with a bulk food section, find out if they will allow you to bring in and use your own packaging. Jars, Tupperware, and reusable baggies are great for buying whatever is available to you in bulk, be it pantry staples, condiments, herbs and spices, treats and snacks, tea and coffee, or fresh items. (I am lucky enough to live near a zero-waste grocery store, where I can stock up on all kinds of things, including perishable items like tofu, plant-based cheeses and cream cheese, hummus, pesto, veggie burgers, samosas, and more.) Just make sure that the store you are shopping at has a system for weighing your containers and such before you load them up, so that they can deduct the weight of your packaging from your bill.</li>
      <li>Shopping at markets is also a good way to avoid unnecessary packaging found in typical grocery stores. Farmers markets, seasonal markets, and festive markets can all be good places to get package-free produce and prepared items. Just bring your own storage options and ask vendors if they can place your purchases in your own packaging instead of theirs.</li>
      <li>It is also possible to minimize your waste at regular grocery stores. Most produce is typically sold without packaging, so instead of relying on the disposal bags provided in the produce section, simply bring your own. I sometimes use my reusable bags, and sometimes I re-use plastic bags I accumulated from before I started cutting down my waste (for example, bags that used to hold apples, carrots, celery and bread). You can also sometimes get items from other sections of the store put into your own packaging, too: loose baked items for example, or sometimes things from the deli or prepared foods section if the store will allow this.</li>
      <li>Some items, unfortunately, are simply not available without packaging. I do what I can to make these items from scratch, using items that are available package-free, but do continue to purchase certain things that I am not yet prepared to do without. For me, this means occasionally buying things like cans of coconut milk, cans or jars of curry pastes, bags of tortilla chips, and plant-based meat alternatives (like veggie sausages or seasoned tofu). I do this sparingly, and encourage you to take your commitment to waste reduction as far as you desire.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Scratch Cooking</h5>
    <p>When time and skill allow, I like to make as many things as possible from scratch. Not only does this help me to reduce my waste, but it also means that I typically get to enjoy fresh, preservative-free food, made exactly how I like it. Here are the things I try to avoid buying pre-made, because they are quite easy to make yourself.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beans and lentils: although they take a lot of time to cook (beans in particular, unless you are fancy and you own a pressure cooker), they require minimal effort. For most beans, you just need to soak them in water overnight, drain, and then simmer on the stove for about 45-60 minutes, until they are tender. Some lentils require pre-soaking as well, but many varieties cook in as little as 15 minutes without soaking. Canned varieties are typically full of salt, so cooking them yourself means you can cut down the sodium and the waste, while enjoying delicious, fresh beans and lentils.</li>
      <li>Nut milk: I enjoy almost all plant-based milks, and you can buy or milk made out of nuts, seeds, grains and legumes, but my go-to options are typically almond and cashew. They are incredibly easy to make, are quite cost-effective, and nutritious. <a href='http://www.elizabethrider.com/cashew-milk-recipe/' target='_blank'>Here is a typical cashew milk recipe</a>, and <a href='https://ohsheglows.com/2013/01/24/my-favourite-homemade-almond-milk-step-by-step-photos/' target='_blank'>here is one for almond milk</a>. The best part is, you can customize it however you like. Try adding soaked dates, cinnamon, cocoa, or anything else if you want, for variety and something extra special. </li>
      <li>Dips and spreads: in the past few years, I have begun trying to make more of my favourite dips and spreads at home. Some of my favourites are <a href='https://ohsheglows.com/2010/12/04/the-hummus-that-changed-everything/' target='_blank'>hummus</a> (using home-cooked chickpeas), <a href='https://minimalistbaker.com/simple-baba-ganoush/' target='_blank'>baba ganoush</a> (with smokey roasted eggplant), <a href='https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/wonderful-salsa-9272' target='_blank'>salsa</a> (I like the kind that requires cooking, and store it in the freezer to save the hassle of canning), spinach dip (a plant-based version of <a href='http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/baked-cream-cheese-spinach-dip-118103' target='_blank'>this</a>) and fruit jams (using fresh berries from the farmers market or a pick-your-own orchard and sweetened with maple syrup, stored in the freezer).</li>
      <li>Sauces, dressings and seasonings: similar to the above, I also like to make my own sauces and dressings wherever possible. My go-to salad dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette (made with heart-healthy olive oil and a bit of maple syrup instead of refined sugar) and I also make a lemon tahini dressing on occasion (with freshly squeezed lemon and tahini purchased in bulk) for bowls and to serve with falafels. I am a huge fan of air-popped popcorn, and this easy <a href='https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/dorito-popcorn-seasoning-519068' target='_blank'>Doritos-style seasoning mix</a> (dairy-free) is a hit in my house.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Food Storage</h5>
    <p>It’s a good idea to assemble a variety of multi-use packaging options that you can use when shopping and for storing food at home. Having these items on hand at the store and in your kitchen will make it easy to swap disposal packaging options for ones that you can use over and over again. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jars: sturdy, plastic-free and aesthetically pleasing, jars are a great option for storing food. Whether used for preparing and transporting meals, storing dried goods, or holding homemade creations, jars are incredibly versatile. I have a collection of assorted jars from previous purchases of sauces, condiments, pickles, salsa and the like, and I use them every single day to hold pantry items and certain fresh foods. If you do not already have some on hand they are usually inexpensive to buy new, or you may be able to find them for free from people who prefer to rehome them, rather than to recycle them. </li>
      <li>Tupperware: if you are not opposed to using plastic, any sort of containers will of course be helpful when buying and storing food. I like to use big containers for things like tofu, vegetable burgers, samosas and treats that I buy in bulk. My Tupperware collection is mismatched and half made up of old containers from take-out and store-bought items like ready-made hummus and non-dairy sour cream, but it gets the job done. </li>
      <li>Stainless steel or glass containers: If you prefer to not use plastic, there are wonderful food storage options made of stainless steel and glass. They are great for storing bulk items, prepared foods, lunches and snacks on the go, and anything else you can think of.</li>
      <li>Stasher bags: I learned about these nifty silicone replacements for Ziploc bags at a zero-waste presentation I went to several months after deciding to work on reducing my waste, and was thrilled to find out they exist. Stashers are reusable, non-toxic, responsibly produced, and safe for the stove-top, microwave, oven, fridge, freezer and dishwasher. They are supposed to be “endlessly reusable”, but if they do wear out the company has a repurposing program to convert them into safe playground pebbles. How cool is that?</li>
      <li>Food covers and wraps: there are all kinds of options available now for covering and wrapping food. I personally prefer to store things in containers, but this is a great option for covering bowls and dishes that do not have lids (especially helpful for storing leftovers without having to transfer food). Silicone covers (set sizes and stretchy versions) seem popular, and I have heard good things about beeswax food wraps as well. </li>
