    <h3>Dining Out</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Fast Food With Long Term Consequences</h4>
    <p>People love going out to eat. In 2017, Canadian households spent an average of about $2600 on meals, snacks and drinks from restaurants, or 23.3% of their total food spending. (Average household expenditure on all food purchases, from both stores and restaurants, was just over $11,120 in the same year.) Dining out can be a fun, convenient and delicious experience, but it can also be quite wasteful, especially when take-out and delivery are involved.</p>
    <p>Did you know that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Restaurants, hospitals and institutions are <a href='https://globalnews.ca/news/4857582/canada-food-waste-study-2019/' target='blank'>responsible for 13% of all avoidable food waste in Canada</a> (that's significant considering that 58% of all food produced in the country is lost or wasted).</li>
      <li><a href='Research in the United States shows that an individual restaurant can produce up to 75,000 pounds of food waste in only one year.' target='blank'>Research</a> in the United States shows that an individual restaurant can produce up to 75,000 pounds of food waste in only one year.</li>
      <li>Alarmingly, restaurants toss an estimated 85% of unused food, rather than donating or recycling it. Yet reports say that businesses could save $8 for every dollar invested in reducing waste.</li>
      <li>According to Statistics Canada, annual sales at fast-food restaurants alone <a href='https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180221/dq180221d-eng.htm' target='blank'>totalled $30.5 billion in 2017</a>. Assuming an average of $10 a meal, that translates into 83 fast-food meals per person last year — and a LOT of associated waste.</li>
      <li>One of Canada's most populous cities, Vancouver, <a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/zero-waste-takeout-1.4867042' target='blank'>reports</a> that takeout containers and disposable cups represent nearly 50 per cent of all garbage collected from public waste bins.</li>
      <li>According to the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S., food and food packaging together make up about <a href='https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/reducing_wasted_food_pkg_tool.pdf' target='blank'>45 percent of all the materials in US landfills</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thankfully, there are options for addressing this problem. Below are some helpful tidbits and tricks fore reducing waste generated by going out to eat.</p>
    <h4>Dining Out</h4>
    <p>As an individual, there are a few things we can do to curb waste associated with dining out (or ordering delivery). Of course, if you can opt to dine in somewhere, rather than ordering food to go, you will easily eliminate a lot of unnecessary packaging that almost always goes into a landfill, since delivery and take-out are among the worst culprits of food-related trash. However, whether you go out to a restaurant to eat or order take-out, here are some ways to do so more sustainably:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Order consciously:</strong> first and foremost, be realistic about what you can eat. Restaurant portions are often far larger than they need to be, which leads to a lot of food waste. Try ordering a smaller portion, if possible (some restaurants will do this upon request), sharing meals with others or asking questions about the size of a dish before you order, so that you can make an informed choice.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan for leftovers:</strong> unless you never have trouble finishing a meal, it's a good habit to assume that you may have leftovers that you will want to bring home. Bring your own reusable container so that you don't have to rely on a restaurant's single-use packaging. A small piece of Tupperware, tucked into a purse or briefcase or backpack, can be a lifesaver if you find yourself facing what I call the “doggy bag dilemma”, where you're left debating whether it's better to waste the food you can't finish or the packaging of a doggy bag. A reusable sandwich or snack bag will also work in a pinch, if you prefer not to carry a more bulky container.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan for take-out and delivery:</strong> getting food to go has never been more popular, because of its convenience. However, even just a single take-out order can generate a lot of waste. Wherever possible, bring your own containers for your take-out order. If you know you want to grab something quick on the way home from work, for example, bring some Tupperware with you so that you can transport your food in a reusable container, rather than a paper, plastic or styrofoam package. Or, if you're placing an order ahead of time, let the restaurant know that you'd like to use your own containers. They won't always be able to accommodate your request, but some will so it is always worth asking. If you know you will be eating away from home in a setting where you will not have access to reusable cutlery and napkins, you can also bring your own set to avoid these single-use items.</li>
      <li><strong>Say no to 'extras':</strong> this is especially important when ordering food to go, but it can be relevant when going out to eat as well. Oftentimes, restaurants will give you plastic cutlery, straws, lots of napkins and packages of sauces and condiments with your meal, even if you don't ask for them. Politely say no to anything you do not actually need, and return it to the restaurant so that they can give it to someone who will actually use it.</li>
      <li><strong>Support businesses that take waste seriously:</strong> don't overlook the importance of 'voting' with your wallet when you do dine out. By supporting businesses that are making a genuine effort to operate more sustainably, you are helping them to raise the bar for the foodservice industry, and sending a message to other businesses that eco-conscious business practices matter to you. Just be sure to give feedback to the restaurants you do, or do not, support, so they know that sustainability is a priority to their customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Foodservice Industry</h4>
    <p>If you work in the restaurant or foodservice industry, or if you simply want to be able to offer suggestions to your favourite food outlets to help them cut down on their waste, consider these tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Restaurants and institutions should have a composting and recycling system in place, which means that everyone is aware of it and it is easy to adhere to. For example, since waste inevitably ends up in the easiest-to-reach disposal location, ensure that compost and recycling bins are at least as accessible as the regular garbage bin, if not more. If your municipality does not offer sufficient waste removal, look into private waste hauling companies and/or investigate other options in your community, such as a community garden that can use your compost.</li>
      <li>Wherever possible, donate leftovers. There is a misconception among the hospitality industry that donating leftover food to people in need is risky, because they could be sued if someone becomes ill. In reality, the law actually protects caterers, restaurants, manufacturers, importers, distributors, retailers, and private individuals who donate food. As noted by the <a href='http://www.nzwc.ca/Documents/FoodDonation-LiabilityDoc.pdf' target='blank'>National Zero Waste Council</a>, “In every part of Canada, the law provides protections for companies and individuals who donate food rather than throwing it away. The laws are worded in various ways, but they all provide food donors with a strong defence if a consumer sues because of illness caused by the donated food. … This is probably why there is no reported case in Canada of anyone (whether a food bank or a food donor) being sued as result of illness or damage caused by consumption of donated food.” As long as businesses operate in good faith and exercise due diligence (e.g., by paying attention to food quality and safety) they are unlikely to experience issues with liability. So please, coordinate with local shelters and food banks to give your leftovers to people in need, especially if you offer a buffet. (The NZWC has many additional resources on <a href='http://www.nzwc.ca/focus-areas/food/resources/Pages/default.aspx' target='blank'>their website</a> that may be helpful.)</li>
      <li>Do not shy away from using 'ugly' produce or food scraps. The 'imperfect food movement' has grown in recent years in recognition of the fact that, although misshapen fruits and vegetables do not differ in taste or nutritional value from their more aesthetically-pleasing counterparts, a staggeringly high proportion of produce goes to waste. <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/04/18/americans-waste-about-a-quarter-of-the-food-they-buy-and-the-environmental-consequences-are-staggering/?utm_term=.4b80fff87f7e' target='blank'>In the USA at least</a>, an estimated 25-40% of all food is wasted, and fruits and vegetables accounted for the biggest share (39%) of wasted food “due to spoilage and imperfections in appearance”. The movement has its own 'imperfections', with critics noting that small farms may be left out of the market and that produce may be diverted from institutions who rely on it, like food banks. However, I think it is worth reducing the wariness associated with less-than-perfect vegetables and fruit, especially if the foodservice industry starts donating more of its leftovers to people in need, as noted above. </li>
      <li>Finally, consider offering different portion sizes. Some restaurants offer two options for main dishes, a smaller 'lunch' sized entrée or a larger, 'dinner' sized entrée, so that customers are not forced to order a meal they know they cannot finish.</li>
