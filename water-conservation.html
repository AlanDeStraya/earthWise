    <h3>Water Conservation</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>Liquid Gold</h4>
    <p>Water is a very precious resource. Despite the fact that about 75% of the world’s surface is covered in water, <a href='https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water' target='_blank'>most of it is unavailable to us</a>. A staggering 97.5% of the world’s water is salt water and only 2.5% of it is freshwater, and of that some is inaccessible or impractical for human use, so in reality we can use about just 1% of the global water supply. Given that we literally cannot live without it, it is so important that we conserve the limited freshwater supply we have.</p>
    <p>You may be surprised to know that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We use 10 billion tons of freshwater worldwide, every day.</li>
      <li>Per person water use varies greatly by region. In 2009, the National Post <a href='http://www.nationalpost.com/rss/study+calls+average+water+Canadians+alarming/1402591/story.html' target='_blank'>reported</a> that Canadians used an average of 329 litres of water per person per day, second only to the United States (about 400 litres per person per day), about twice as much as Europea, and much higher than most developing countries. And the 328 litres figure might be conservative; in 2013, Statistics Canada <a href='https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dai/smr08/2017/smr08_215_2017' target='_blank'>stated</a> that the average Canadian used 466 litres of water per day (although this includes residential, industrial, commercial and other uses of water provided by public utilities).</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, many people around the world do not have enough clean water to meet their needs: according to <a href='https://water.org/our-impact/water-crisis/' target='_blank'>Water.org</a>, an alarming 1 in 9 people lack access to safe water and 1 in 3 people lack access to proper sanitation (such as toilets). This amounts to 844 million people living without safe water access and 2.3 billion living without sanitation.</li>
      <li>Tragically, this water scarcity causes <a href='https://water.org/our-impact/water-crisis/' target='_blank'>1 million people</a> to die each year from water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases. In fact, every two minutes, a child dies from a water-related disease.</li>
      <li>The world’s water crisis disproportionately affects women and girls, who are often responsible for household activities like collecting water. Long journeys to collect water detract from their ability to work or go to school.</li>
      <li>Worldwide, agriculture accounts for <a href='https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/chart-globally-70-freshwater-used-agriculture' target='_blank'>70% of all water consumption</a>, compared to <a href='http://www.worldometers.info/water/' target='_blank'>20% for industry and 10% for domestic use</a>.</li>
      <li>In 2018, the Guardian <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/18/are-we-running-out-of-water' target='_blank'>reported</a> that by 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in “water-stressed” areas. As with most resource-related issues, the poorest countries will likely suffer the most.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have a long wa to go toward establishing a healthy, sustainable relationship with water, but we can each do our part at home, and in our daily lives, to be part of the solution rather than the problem.</p>
    <h4>Water Conservation</h4>
    <p>Here are some ways to save water in your day-to-day life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invest in highly efficient appliances like washing machines and dishwashers whenever possible, and only run them when they are full. If they have multiple settings, run them on the shortest cycle that also gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Turn off taps when they do not need to be on. For example, while brushing your teeth, shaving, washing your hands or fruits or vegetables, scrubbing dirty dishes, and shampooing or conditioning your hair.</li>
      <li>Transition to low-flow toilets to reduce water use. Apparently, <a href='https://greenhomeguide.com/know-how/article/remodel-your-home-sustainably' target='_blank'>toilets could account for 27% of all household water use</a>, which can be cut down by upgrading to a toilet with a low-volume and/or dual-flush mechanism.</li>
      <li>Reduce the number of times you actually flush your toilet to 1-3 times per day, using grey water the rest of the time. Since each flush uses between 6-12 litres, depending on the efficiency of your toilet, every time you do not flush you are saving several days’ worth of drinking water.</li>
      <li>Low-flow shower heads also reduce water use, by <a href='https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Environmental-health/see-how-much-water-do-you-use-per-day-20170613' target='_blank'>as much as 50%</a>: a five-minute shower with a regular shower head uses approximately 80 litres of water, while a shower of the same length with a low-flow head uses about 40 litres.</li>
      <li>Take shorter showers. As one of the biggest culprits when it comes to domestic water use, showers are a great opportunity to conserve water. In addition to upgrading your shower head and turning off the water when you don’t need it, get into the habit of being efficient while getting clean, rather than lingering or taking your time.</li>
      <li>Collect the water you run when waiting for the tap to run hot or cold, and use it to drink, cook, rinse dishes, water plants, or wash clothing items that must be cleaned by hand.</li>
      <li>Let dishes soak with a small amount of water before washing them, to reduce the amount of water needed to actually wash them.</li>
      <li>When shaving, rather than rinsing your razor in running water, fill the sink (or a cup) with a few inches of water and rinse the razor in that.</li>
      <li>Check your faucets and pipes for leaks, as they can be a significant source of wasted water without you even realizing it.</li>
      <li>Reduce the number of things you buy. Items like clothing take a surprising amount of water to produce: 10,000 litres of water are required to produce a pair of jeans, and 2,500 litres go into the average T-shirt. Being a more mindful consumer can go a long way towards reducing your water footprint.</li>
      <li>Finally, adjust your dietary patterns to consume more <a href='https://www.liveearthwise.com/food/plantbased-for-the-planet' target='_blank'>plant-based foods</a>, which consume significantly less water than animal-based foods. A <a href='https://phys.org/news/2011-01-footprints-animal-proteins.html' target='_blank'>study from the University of Twente</a> calculated that a kilogram of beef uses 15,000 litres; pork 6,000 litres; chicken 4,300 litres. 4,000 litres; and soya beans 2,100 litres.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Water Preservation</h4>
    <p>Aside from reducing water use, it is also important to preserve the quality of our water. Here are some easy ways to keep our water system clean:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not pour contaminated liquids, pills, drugs, or other medications down the drain.</li>
      <li>Do not dispose of any type of fat, oil, or grease (for example, from cooking) down the sink. It belongs in the compost or garbage instead (refer to your city's waste management program).</li>
      <li>Do not throw trash into your toilet.</li>
      <li>Do not use bleach or other harsh cleaning agents, and if you do, do not pour them down the sink.</li>
      <li>Do not litter, and clean up any litter you do see, when you are able.</li>
      <li>Minimize your use of plastic, which often ends up in our waterways.</li>
      <li>Minimize your use of pesticides and herbicides, in favour of organic food production.</li>
      <li>Minimize your consumption of animal products generated from factory farming, since they are often the biggest users and polluters of our water system.</li>
    </ul>
