    <h3>DIY Personal Care</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>The DIY Movement</h4>
    <p>In the good ol’ days, people did everything by hand, mainly out of necessity. Thanks to industrialization, automation, and more efficient divisions of labour, however, a large portion of the population in developed countries stopped making their own clothing, growing their own food, and building their own houses. While this shift away from hard, manual labour has undoubtedly allowed us to accomplish more with fewer resources (time, energy, and often money), there is something to be said for doing something yourself, from scratch.</p>
    <p>There are several benefits of doing it yourself when it comes to personal care:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can be selective with your ingredients to avoid harsh chemicals and irritants, and as a result you will know exactly what is in the products you use;</li>
      <li>You can customize your products so that they are perfectly suited to your tastes and needs;</li>
      <li>You can reduce the waste associated with commercial products, by sourcing things in bulk and reusing your containers;</li>
      <li>You can usually save money too, since buying ingredients is often much cheaper than purchasing a finished product; and</li>
      <li>You can spread the love by gifting your creations to family and friends for holidays and special occasions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To help you get started on your own DIY personal care product journey, read on for some tips and helpful ideas!</p>
    <h4>DIY Personal Care</h4>
    <p>When it comes to DIY options, the sky is the limit. You can make just about anything, from homemade sunscreen and deodorant to DIY soaps, ointments and makeup. In fact, there are so many options out there that it can be overwhelming to know where to start. Here are some tips to help you begin:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As with any major change, start slowly. Identify 1-2 products at a time that you want to learn how to make yourself, beginning with those that you either use most often or are having a hard time finding in a form you are happy with.</li>
      <li>Before you attempt any actual recipes, do a bit of background reading into the most common ingredients in homemade personal care products, such as natural oils, essential oils, butters and waxes, to begin to understand their typical uses and health benefits.</li>
      <li>When you are ready to get to it, find at least 3 or 4 recipes for the product you want to replace. For example, if you decide to start with a DIY shampoo, do not just search until you find one recipe you like. Rather, try to find multiple recipes that appeal to you, based on the ingredients and equipment they require, their stated benefits, and reviews from others who have tried them out. Having a few recipes on hand when you try to make your own shampoo for the first time will mean that you are knowledgeable about different ways that particular ingredients can come together using different equipment and methods, so that you can slowly start to become more creative and have a better chance at troubleshooting anything that may go wrong.</li>
      <li>Test in small batches. To avoid wasting a lot of time, money and energy, it’s generally a good practice to make small batches of a product at a time. You never know if a recipe will work for you and if you will like the end result, so be sure to scale back a recipe whenever possible if you have never made it before.</li>
      <li>Finally, try to keep an open mind while you experiment. There are many very simple, straightforward recipes available for everything from salves to scrubs, but if something does not work out the way you envisioned, don’t give up. You can also make the process more fun by doing it with friends or family – have everyone pick a new recipe to try and create your products side-by-side. This way, you can test out several products at once, in addition to enjoying the others’ company. In the end, the feeling of creating something for yourself from scratch, that you know is better for you than most conventional products, will be so rewarding!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it comes to sourcing ingredients and other things you will need, here are a few suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edible ingredients — such as sugars, oats, oils, spices, and certain butters, like cocoa butter — are likely available in bulk, so you can probably buy these using your own containers or bags. Otherwise, for things like essential oils, lye and waxes, your best bet is probably a local health food store or online.</li>
      <li>Containers, pots, bottles and jars for storing your homemade products are likewise probably best sourced from a local health food store or online, unless you are able to use/reuse containers you already have at home. They are usually quite affordable and can be made of glass, metal or plastic, so you can choose what you want based on your needs, budget and preferences.</li>
      <li>The equipment you will need for your recipes will vary, but most commonly you will want to ensure you have a saucepan, bowls, spoons, spatulas or scrapers, a strainer, funnels, measuring cups and spoons, a thermometer, molds, and a kitchen scale. It is also helpful to have rubber or safety gloves and goggles if you will be working with materials like lye, which is used to make soap from scratch and can cause serious burns.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that homemade products may degrade, or go bad, faster than their regular, store-bought counterparts, because of their simple and pure ingredient lists. This is another good reason to make things in small batches where possible, and to otherwise be mindful of where you store things; for example, away from light and heat is most likely best in most cases, but this will of course depend on the ingredients you use.</li>
