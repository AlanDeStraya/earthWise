    <h3>Zero Waste Out and About</h3>

    <h4>Zero Waste Outside Tips</h4>

      <h4>The Zero-Waste Movement</h4>
      <p>A zero-waste lifestyle is, of course, about eliminating waste. The goal is to do so entirely, but it's often more pursued than achieved. The idea of producing absolutely no waste may sound daunting, but some easy lifestyle changes can drastically reduce a lot of waste generated each year.</p>
      <p>Bea Johnson is often called the founder of the zero-waste lifestyle movement, thanks to her book <a href='https://zerowastehome.com/' target='_blank'>Zero Waste Home.</a> Bea and her family generate a mere quart of waste per year. I particularly like their concept of the Five R’s. In order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Refuse</strong> what you don't need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce</strong> what you do need.</li>
        <li><strong>Reuse</strong> by using reusables.</li>
        <li><strong>Recycle</strong> what you cannot refuse, reduce, or reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Rot</strong> (compost) the rest.”</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <p>A little bit of preparedness can go a long way towards helping you to reduce your waste while you’re on the go:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have a “sustainability bag” packed and ready to go, so that you can easily take it with you on trips – whether they are just a few hours or a few days. Include things you know you are likely to need, like a reusable water bottle, travel mug, piece of Tupperware, set of reusable cutlery, a cloth napkin, a hand towel, and a reusable Ziploc-style baggie. If you have a car, you can store the bag there. Otherwise keep it somewhere handy, like near your door, so you can grab it on your way out.</li>
      <li>Get into the habit of identifying the ways in which you tend to produce waste while out and about, and develop solutions that fit your needs. For example, I know that when I go to a restaurant, there is a good chance that I will not be able to finish my meal. Rather than forcing myself to eat more than I want to, or getting it to go (in a single-use container), I almost always bring a small piece of Tupperware with me, so that I can easily take leftovers home for later. Meanwhile my partner, a self-professed coffee addict, always takes his travel mug with him when we go out for a walk, to do errands, or to meet friends, since he knows he is likely to want a coffee to go.</li>
      <li>Carry a little bit of hand soap and a small towel with you, so you can avoid using chemical-laden soap, and unhygienic air dryers, and single-use hand towels in public washrooms. You can store these in a little pouch or baggie, ideally made of mesh or another breathable material so that the towel can dry between uses.</li>
      <li>Ensure you have a good system for taking your toiletries with you while travelling. For example, it can be helpful to get a good set of reusable bottles or jars (made of glass, silicone or durable plastic) that you can refill with your preferred personal care products. This allows you to continue using your own, greener products while away from home, and avoids the waste associated with disposable, travel-size toiletries more commonly used on trips. I also like having a toothbrush holder and a case for my bar of soap. If I know I will be staying somewhere like a hotel, which may not have reusable glasses in the bathroom or bedroom, I will also usually bring my own small cup.</li>
      <li>Keep at least one reusable bag or tote in your suitcase, briefcase, or purse, so that can always be prepared for an unexpected purchase or emergency. When I know I will be away for more than a day, I usually carry a shopping tote and some reusable produce bags, in case I want to buy groceries somewhere rather than going out to eat.</li>
      <li>    Develop a packing system that works for you and minimizes waste. For example, rather than relying on things like plastic bags for organizing the contents of my suitcase, or storing dirty laundry while away, I prefer reusable packing cubes. They allow you to create “compartments” within a suitcase to keep your items neat, and last a long time.</li>
    </ul>
