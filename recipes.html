      <h4>The Joy of Cooking</h4>
      <p>Assuming you have the opportunity, ability and will, cooking at home can be a fun adventure, especially if you are exploring new ingredients and recipes. It’s a chance to be creative, to work with your hands, to know exactly what you’re eating, and to customize your food to your personal preferences. It is also a great way to be more connected to your food, and to appreciate the effort that goes into creating a home-cooked meal.</p>
      <p>Below are some of my own recipes, as well as links to my favourite plant-based food blogs for more ideas and inspiration.</p>

        <h5>Protein-Packed Breakfast Scramble</h5>
        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free | Nut-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Serves 4</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> coconut or extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li><strong>2 cups</strong> mixed veggies, chopped (e.g. white onion, zucchini and broccoli)</li>
          <li><strong>1 block</strong> firm or extra-firm tofu</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> tumeric</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> sea or Himalayan salt</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat the oil.</li>
          <li>Drain the tofu, and allow it to rest somewhere where the water can continue to drain out of it. If you like to press your tofu, to remove the excess water and allow it to better absorb flavour, you can either use a tofu press, or wrap the block of tofu in a clean tea towel and set a weight (such as a heavy book) on top of it.</li>
          <li>When the oil is heated, add the mixed vegetables and sautée until they are slightly tender. You may need to add a bit of water to get the vegetables to cook sufficiently.</li>
          <li>While the vegetables are cooking, use your hands to crumble the block of tofu. You want to get rid of any big chunks, until it slightly resembles colourless scrambled eggs.</li>
          <li>Add the tofu, turmeric, salt and pepper to the skillet or wok. Stir to combine, and allow the mixture to heat through. Add a bit of water (1 tbsp at a time) if the mixture is sticking to the pan.</li>
          <li>Adjust the seasonings to your taste, and enjoy with a side of homefries, avocado toast, salad or fresh fruit.</li>

        <h5>Classic French Toast</h5>
        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Soy-free option | Nut-free option</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Serves 4</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 1/4 cup</strong> non-dairy milk (soy, almond, cashew, oat...)</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> hemp seeds</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> chia seeds</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> cinnamon</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> vanilla extract</li>
          <li><strong>8 slices</strong> whole grain bread</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine the non-dairy milk, hemp seeds, chia seeds, cinnamon and vanilla extract in a blender. Blend on medium to high speed for about 2 minutes, until the mixture is smooth.</li>
          <li>While the blender is going, heat a skillet over medium heat. If your pan is not non-stick, add 1 tsp of oil or non-dairy butter.</li>
          <li>Pour the milk/seed mixture into a shallow dish, and dip each slice of bread into the mixture briefly, flipping it over so that it is coated on both sides.</li>
          <li>Add the dipped bread to the pan and cook for about 4 minutes, then flip and cook for another 3 minutes, or until lightly browned on each side.</li>
          <li>Serve with pure maple syrup and freshly cut fruit.</li>

        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free | Soy-free | Nut-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Serves 1</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2 1/2 cups</strong> filtered water</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> hemp hearts</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> chia seeds</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> frozen, peeled banana</li>
          <li><strong>2 handfuls</strong> spinach or kale, washed (kale de-stemmed)</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> cocoa powder (I use Camino's fair trade, organic cocoa</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> cinnamon</li>
          <li><strong>1 scoop</strong> protein powder (optional)</li>
          <li><strong>4</strong> ice cubes</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Add the water, hemp and chia seeds to a blender. Allow to soak for at least 5 minutes, so that the seeds absorb some of the water.</li>
          <li>Add the banana, spinach or kale, cocoa, cinnamon, and protein powder (if using).</li>
          <li>Blend on high speed for about 3 minutes or until smooth. You may need to stop the blender halfway in between to prevent it from becoming overheated.</li>
          <li>Add the ice cubes and blend for another 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>Pour into a tall glass, and enjoy.</li>

        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Soy-free option | Nut-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Yields 2 loaves (24 slices)</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>5 TBSP</strong> ground flax seed</li>
          <li><strong>6</strong> very ripe bananas, peeled</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> cane sugar (or 2/3 cups erythritol)</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> blackstrap molasses (or maple syrup)</li>
          <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> coconut oil (melted) or grapeseed oil</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> unsweetened non-dairy milk, ideally at room temperature (soy, almond, cashew, oat or whatever you prefer)</li>
          <li><strong>2 cups</strong> flour (I recommend light spelt flour; you can use 100% whole wheat pastry flour as well, but the loaf will be a little bit more dense; for a lighter, mostly whole wheat option, I suggest 1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour  and1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour)</li>
          <li><strong>4 scoops</strong> (60g or 128cc) plant-based protein powder (I used Naked Nutrition yellow pea protein, but any unsweetened plant-based protein powder should work)</li>
          <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> oats (quick cooking, large flake or rolled)</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> baking powder</li>
          <li><strong>1 1/2 tsp</strong> baking soda</li>
          <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> ground cinnamon</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> sea or Himalayan salt</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> mix-ins (like nuts, raisins, chocolate chips, shredded coconut) (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease two loaf pans, cake pans or muffin pans with a bit of coconut oil or non-dairy margarine.</li>
          <li>In a small bowl, combine the ground flax seeds with 1/2 cup warm water, stir, and allow to sit for at least 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>In a very large mixing bowl, mash the bananas with a fork or potato masher. Add in the cane sugar, molasses, erythritol (if using) and stir, then add the coconut oil and non-dairy milk and mix well until the sugar is mostly dissolved.</li>
          <li>In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and protein powder, and stir to combine. Add the oats, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, and stir again until combined.</li>
          <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet, stirring gently, until the flour is just incorporated. Do not over-stir. If adding mix-ins, gently fold them in.</li>
          <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared pans, dividing the mixture evenly between the two loaf or muffin pans. Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean (note that baking times will vary based on the pans you use – muffin pans generally need closer to 25-30 minutes, cake pans 35-40 minutes, and loaf pans 50-55 minutes).</li>
          <li>Serve warm with a pat of non-dairy butter, or some peanut or almond butter for extra protein and healthy fat.</li>

        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Nut-free | Gluten-free option</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Serves 4</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>9</strong> whole wheat lasagna noodles (or brown rice/gluten-free noodles if needed)</li>
          <li><strong>2 15oz cans</strong> tomato sauce</li>
          <li><strong>1 package</strong> organic firm tofu (or Yves Veggie Ground Round)</li>
          <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> dried basil</li>
          <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> dried oregano</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> chili powder</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> grapeseed oil</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> medium onion, chopped</li>
          <li><strong>2 cloves</strong> garlic, minced</li>
          <li><strong>3 cups</strong> chopped veggies (I used carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and rainbow chard</li>
          <li><strong>1 cup</strong> shredded vegan cheese</li>
          <li><strong>To taste</strong> salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil on the stove. Add the noodles and cook until they are al dente, then rinse them in cold water. Set aside.</li>
          <li>In a medium-sized bowl, crumble the block of tofu into small pieces (or if using the Ground Round, empty that into the bowl instead). Reserve a half cup of the tomato sauce, then pour the rest of it over the tofu.</li>
          <li>Add the basil and oregano, as well as salt and pepper to taste, into the tofu/tomato sauce mixture. Stir and set aside.</li>
          <li>Heat the grapeseed oil in a large saucepan. Add the chopped onion and a dash of salt and sauté on medium for about 3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the onions are translucent.</li>
          <li>Put a couple of tablespoons of water in the pan and slowly add in your veggies, starting with whatever will take the longest to soften. I started by adding the carrots and letting them cook for about 2 minutes, then added the broccoli and cauliflower and let the mixture cook for another couple of minutes, and finally added the kale and chard.</li>
          <li>When the veggies have started to become slightly tender, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the chili powder and a bit of salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Prepare your casserole dish by spreading about 1/4 cup of the reserved tomato sauce around the bottom of the dish. Layer 3 of the cooked lasagne noodles lengthwise overtop of the tomato sauce.</li>
          <li>Next, spoon half of the onion and veggie mixture overtop of the noodles, spreading the veggies around to create an even layer.</li>
          <li>Pour half of the tofu/tomato sauce mixture over the veggies, distributing it as evenly as possible.</li>
          <li>Lay 3 more of the cooked noodles lengthwise over the veggie layer. Top with the remaining veggies and the rest of the tofu/tomato sauce mixture, spreading both mixtures out as needed.</li>
          <li>Lay down the last 3 noodles and cover with the 1/4 cup of tomato sauce you still have set aside. Sprinkle the cheese over the tomato sauce.</li>
          <li>Cover the casserole dish with a layer of foil, and poke a few holes in the top so some of the steam can escape. Bake at 375 F for 40 minutes, then uncover and bake for another 5 minutes or so until the cheese starts to brown slightly.</li>
          <li>Cut into squares and enjoy, perhaps with some homemade garlic bread and a side salad.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Tips:</strong> For a subtle “kick” to the lasagne, try topping it with Daiya Pepperjack Style Shreds and adding a bit of cayenne pepper to the tomato sauce. For a bit of extra richness, try making a simple <a href='https://www.veggiesdontbite.com/cashew-ricotta-you-cant-even-tell/' target='_blank'>cashew ricotta</a> and spreading it on top of the first two layers of noodles, before you add the veggies and tofu/tomato sauce mixture.</p>

          <li><strong>4 cups</strong> spinach, washed and chopped or 2 cups zucchini, diced</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> garlic hummus</li>
          <li><strong>1 </strong> avocado, sliced or diced</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
          <li>Pierce each sweet potato 6 times with a knife or fork, and place onto a baking sheet. I line mine with a silicone baking mat, you can use foil if you prefer, or place the potatoes directly on the baking sheet.</li>
          <li>Bake the potatoes in the centre of the oven for about 40 minutes or until soft, turning once or twice.</li>
          <li>While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil on the stove over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add the chickpeas, tomatoes, bell pepper, paprika, chili powder, black pepper and salt. Stir until combined, and cook on medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, until the tomatoes are soft. You may need to add a little bit of water to the pan if the mixture is sticking.</li>
          <li>Add the spinach to the chickpea mixture, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Adjust the seasoning to your taste. Keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
          <li>In a bowl, combine the hummus with 1 1/2 tablespoons of water (or more if your hummus is very thick), to make a dressing. </li>
          <li>When the potatoes are fully cooked, place them on a plate or serving dish and cut each one lengthwise down the middle. Do not cut all the way down so that the two halves are separated; you want to be able to open the potato like a book.</li>
          <li>Spoon 1/4 of the chickpea mixture onto each potato. Top with the avocado and 1/4 of the hummus sauce, and sprinkle with a dash more paprika. Enjoy!</li>

        <h5>Spicy Blackened Tofu</h5>
        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free option | Nut-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Serves 4</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> cornstartch or arrowroot powder</li>
          <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> paprika</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> chili powder</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> garlic powder</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> onion powder</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> dried oregano</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> dried thyme</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> sea or Himalayan salt</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> black pepper</li>
          <li><strong>1 block</strong> firm or extra-firm tofu</li>
          <li><strong>2 TBSP</strong> low-sodium soy-sauce (or gluten-free tamari)</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> sesame oil (or other plant-based oil)</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Drain the tofu. In order for it to fully absorb the flavours, it is best to press the tofu as well. You can either use a tofu press, or wrap the block of tofu in a clean tea towel and set a weight (such as a heavy book) on top of it.</li>
          <li>While the tofu is pressing, combine the first 9 ingredients in a shallow bowl and mix until incorporated.</li>
          <li>Remove the tofu from the tea towel or press, and cut it into 1 inch cubes or 1-inch wide strips. Place the tofu into a dish with the soy sauce or tamari, and gently stir or shake it (if you can cover the dish) to coat the tofu in the sauce. Allow the tofu to sit for 5 minutes, stirring or shaking once in between.</li>
          <li>While the tofu is absorbing the soy sauce, add the oil to a pan and heat over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Remove the tofu from the dish, and gently coat each piece in the spice mixture. Add the tofu to the pan.</li>
          <li>Cook on medium heat for about 2 minutes on each side, until the tofu becomes blackened. Serve with your choice of sides (rice, quinoa, potatoes, vegetables).</li>

        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Serves 4</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 block</strong> firm or extra-firm tofu</li>
          <li><strong>2</strong> bell peppers</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> small onion</li>
          <li><strong>8</strong> white mushrooms</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> natural peanut butter</li>
          <li><strong>2 TBSP</strong> soy-sauce</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> lime juice</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> hot sauce</li>
          <li><strong>8</strong> wooden skewers</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li> Drain the tofu and allow it to rest somewhere where the water can continue to drain out of it. If you like to press your tofu, to remove the excess water and allow it to better absorb flavour, you can either use a tofu press, or wrap the block of tofu in a clean tea towel and set a weight (such as a heavy book) on top of it.</li>
          <li>Combine the peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice and hot sauce in a large bowl or dish to make a marinade. Depending on the consistency of your peanut butter, the mixture may be quite thick. Add a bit of warm water (or non-dairy milk) to thin it out, until it is liquid enough to coat the tofu.</li>
          <li>Cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes. Mix the tofu into the peanut marinade, stirring gently until the tofu is coated.</li>
          <li>While the tofu is marinating, prepare the vegetables. Cut the peppers into 1-inch pieces. Cut the mushrooms into halves. Cut the onion into 1-inch chunks.</li>
          <li>Once the tofu has marinated for about 30 minutes, assemble the skewers: slide a piece of pepper onto a skewer, followed by a chunk of onion, a piece of tofu, and half a mushroom. Repeat 2-3 times, depending on the size of your skewer. Repeat for the remaining 7 skewers.</li>
          <li>Using a small brush, brush the skewers with any remaining peanut sauce.</li>
          <li>Grill or bake until the sauce is absorbed and the vegetables are cooked.</li>

          <li><strong>1 cup</strong> chickpea flour (also known as besan, especially at an Indian store)</li>
          <li><strong>1 cup</strong> water</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> large tomato, diced fine</li>
          <li><strong>1</strong> small onion, diced fine</li>

          <li><strong>1/4 tsp</strong> cayenne or hot chili powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat a medium-size skillet on the stove over medium heat. If it is not non-stick, add a little bit of oil or non-dairy butter to coat the pan.</li>
          <li>Combine the chickpea flour and water in a medium-size bowl, and whisk until well combined. It should be a very thin batter, and it is normal for there to be little chunks of chickpea flour still visible.</li>
          <li>Add the tomato, onion and spices, and stir until incorporated.</li>
          <li>Pour ¼ of the chickpea flour mixture into the heated pan, spreading it around so that the vegetables are evenly distributed. Allow it to cook for about 4 minutes, or until the side you can see is almost completely dry. Flip the pancake and continue cooking for about 2 more minutes, until the underside is lightly browned.</li>
          <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture to make three additional pancakes.</li>
          <li>Serve with chutney, salsa, hummus, or whatever other toppings you like!</li>

Remove the pot from heat and let the quinoa rest for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.</li>
          <li>Chop the kale into small, bite-sized pieces and rinse in a colander. (If you like your kale to be more tender, you can gently massage the leaves with an additional 1 tsp of olive oil and allow it to rest for at least 5 minutes.)</li>
          <li>Chop the cabbage into small, thin strips and rinse in a colander.</li>
          <li>Make the peanut sauce by combining the peanut butter, tamari or soy sauce, and Sriracha or hot sauce in a small bowl. Stir until combined and then gradually add the non-dairy milk or water until you have a creamy sauce that is thin enough to be poured over the dish.</li>
          <li>Wash, peel and slice the avocado. </li>

        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>500 g</strong> quality dairy-free dark chocolate (baking/molding chocolate, chocolate chips/bars should work well)</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> shredded, unsweetened coconut (Sunblest brand has no sulphites)</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> seeds and/or nuts (for nut-free, try sunflower, pumpkin and chia seeds)</li>
          <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> dried fruit (I used unsweetened cranberries and wild blueberries)</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Melt the chocolate in a saucepan over low heat, checking it often and stirring frequently so that it doesn't burn. While the chocolate is melting, prepare 1 large (or 2 medium-small baking sheets) with a layer of wax paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
          <li>Once the chocolate is fully melted, remove the pan from the heat and add in your mix-ins. Stir gently until they're well incorporated.</li>
          <li>Spread the mixture out onto the wax paper or baking mat, ideally in the shape of a rectangle, so that it's about half a centimetre thick. Place your baking sheet in the fridge and let the chocolate cool until its hardened (about 30 minutes).</li>
          <li>When the chocolate is fully cooled, gently peel it off the mat/wax paper and break it into medium-large chunks. Try to work quickly so that the chocolate doesn't melt - it needs to stay cool to 'snap' nicely into pieces of bark.</li>
          <li>Store the chocolate in the refrigerator until you're ready to enjoy. If you're going to give it as a gift, just package it in some cellophane or a glass jar, add a ribbon and you're good to go!</li>

        <h5>Candyland Candy Cane Bark</h5>
        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free | Nut-free | Soy-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>1 large baking sheet of bark</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>500 g</strong> quality dairy-free dark chocolate (baking/molding chocolate, chocolate chips/bars should work well)</li>
          <li><strong>1 cup</strong> candy cane pieces (stores like Bulk Barn sell them pre-broken)</li>
          <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> peppermint extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Melt the chocolate in a saucepan over low heat, checking it often and stirring frequently so that it doesn’t burn. While the chocolate is melting, prepare 1 large (or 2 medium-small baking sheets) with a layer of wax paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
          <li>Once the chocolate is fully melted, remove the pan from the heat and add in the peppermint extract. Stir gently until the extract is well incorporated.</li>
          <li>Spread the mixture out onto the wax paper or baking mat, ideally in the shape of a rectangle, so that it’s about half a centimetre thick. </li>
          <li>Sprinkle the candy cane pieces on top, until the chocolate is evenly coated. Gently press down on the top of the candy cane layer so that the pieces will not fall off when the chocolate hardens, being careful not to submerge the candy pieces entirely.</li>
          <li>Place your baking sheet in the fridge and let the chocolate cool until its hardened (about 30 minutes).</li>
          <li>When the chocolate is fully cooled, gently peel it off the mat/wax paper and break it into medium-large chunks. Try to work quickly so that the chocolate doesn’t melt – it needs to stay cool to ‘snap’ nicely into pieces of bark.</li>
          <li>Store in the refrigerator for up to one month.</li>

        <h5>Lightened Up Lemon Cheesecake</h5>
        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free | Nut-free option | Low sugar</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Seves 8</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <em>For the crust</em>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> rolled oats</li>
          <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> raw pecans</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 tsp</strong> sea salt</li>
          <li><strong>2 TBSP</strong> brown, coconut or cane sugar</li>
          <li><strong>4 TBSP</strong> coconut oil (melted)</li>
        </ul>
        <em>For the filling</em>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> raw cashews, soaked overnight, drained and rinsed</li>
          <li><strong>1 package</strong> soft, silken tofu (about 300-340g)</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> coconut cream</li>
          <li><strong>2 TBSP</strong> coconut oil</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> erythritol</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> pure maple syrup</li>
          <li><strong>1 TBSP</strong> arrowroot or cornstarch</li>
          <li><strong>2 TBSP</strong> lemon zest (~2 large lemons zested)</li>
          <li><strong>3 TBSP</strong> lemon juice (~1 large lemon)</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 tsp</strong> Himalayan or sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
          <li>Combine the dry crust ingredients (oats, pecans, salt and sugar) in a blender or food processor and blend until just combined, and there are no large chunks. about 30 seconds. Add the coconut oil and continue to blend until the mixture appears even and crumbly. Check the consistency by pinching a bit of the mixture together with your fingers; it should stick together. If not, try adding a bit more melted coconut oil and blend for another few seconds.</li>
          <li>Pour the crust mixture into an 8x8 springform pan and gently spread it around, so that there is enough to cover a bit of the walls of the pan. Press the mixture down using your fingers or a flat object, such as the bottom of a glass, until it is evenly distributed around the bottom and lower sides of the pan. </li>
          <li>Bake the crust for 12-15 minutes in centre of oven, until it starts to brown around the edges.</li>
          <li>While the crust is baking, add all of the filling ingredients except the cornstarch to a high speed blender. Blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Finally, add the cornstarch and continue mixing. The mixture should be fairly thick. Taste it and adjust the sweetness or lemon favour if needed.</li>
          <li>Allow the crust to cool for at least 5 minutes before pouring the filling over it. Bake for 40 minutes, until the centre is still slightly wet but not liquid, and the outer edges are dry (they may even appear a bit cracked).</li>
          <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool, then set in the fridge for at least four hours, or overnight. Enjoy with non-dairy whipped cream and toasted coconut flakes, or whatever other toppings you like.</li>

          <li>Mix Bisquick, sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.</li>
          <li>Using a fork or pastry cutter, cut in the Earth Balance or margarine until the mixture is crumbly. There should be no large pieces of Earth Balance left.</li>
          <li>Next, add the non-dairy milk, vanilla extract and lemon zest, stirring to combine. Add the blueberries and stir gently.</li>
          <li>Drop large spoonfuls of the batter onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 9-12 minutes, or until the scones are a light golden brown.</li>
          <li>For extra sweetness, create a glaze by mixing 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp water and 1/4 cup vegan icing sugar together in a small bowl. Brush the scones with the glaze immediately after removing them from the oven.</li>
          <li>Allow to cool slightly, then serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> For another delicious variation, replace the lemon zest with orange zest, the fresh blueberries with 1/2 cup dried cranberries, and the 1 tsp lemon juice with 1 tbsp orange juice.</p>

        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 1/2 cup</strong> raw cashews soaked for at least 8 hours</li>
          <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> water</li>
          <li><strong>1 tsp </strong> (or less) Himalayan or sea salt</li>
          <li><strong>1-2 TBSP</strong> lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
          <li><strong>1 </strong> probiotic capsule OR 1 TBSP non-dairy yogurt</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Equipment note:</strong> you will need a high-speed blender or food processor, or some cheesecloth and a colander.</p>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Add the cashews, water, salt, and vinegar or lemon juice to your blender or food processor.</li>
          <li>Blend or process until smooth, adding additional water (1 tsp at a time) as needed, to keep the mixture moving. You may need to stop the blender or food processor a few times to scrape down the sides, to ensure that all of the cashew pieces are well blended.</li>
          <li>Taste the mixture, adding slightly more salt, lemon juice or vinegar according to your preferences.</li>
          <li>When you are finished blending, empty the contents of the probiotic capsule or add your non-dairy yogurt into the mixture and stir to combine.</li>
          <li>Transfer the mixture to a clean glass dish (such as a Pyrex bowl) or jar. Cover loosely with a lid and drape a towel overtop. Store in a room temperature area for 24 hours, such as inside a cupboard or on top of your fridge, to allow the bacteria to grow.</li>
          <li>If you prefer your cheese to be very thin and spreadable, similar to the consistency of hummus, you can eat it right away. Otherwise if you prefer a slightly firmer cheese, more similar to chèvre, follow steps 6-8.</li>
          <li>Place your colander in a bowl, and line the colander with a double or layer of cheesecloth. Pour your cashew mixture into the centre of the cheesecloth.</li>
          <li>Pull up the edges of the cheesecloth and bunch them on top, and tie them loosely with an elastic band. Your cashew cheese should sit in a soft ball shape in your colander, with the bowl underneath to catch excess water.</li>
          <li>Place the colander in your fridge for 3-4 days, so that the excess water slowly seeps out of your cheesecloth and into the bowl. When the cheese is slightly firm to the touch, unwrap it and enjoy.</li>
          <li>Store your finished cheese in an airtight container, or in a reusable wrap. Enjoy with crackers, toast or bagels, with jam or as a pizza topping.</li>

        <h5>Homemade Nut Milk</h5>
        <p class='recipe-type'>Vegan | Gluten-free | Soy-free</p>
        <p class='recipe-serves'>Makes about 1 L</p>
        <h6>Ingredients</h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 cup</strong> raw cashews or raw almonds, soaked for at least 8 hours</li>
          <li><strong>4 cups</strong> water</li>
          <li><strong>1 pinch</strong> Himalayan or sea salt</li>
          <li><strong>Optional flavoring:</strong> pitted dates, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Equipment note:</strong> if making almond milk, you will need a nut milk bag, colander, cheesecloth or fine mesh sieve.</p>
        <h6>Directions:</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Drain and rinse your soaked cashews or almonds.</li>
          <li>Add to a blender with the water, and any solid flavourings (like dates and cinnamon) if using, and blend on high speed for about 3 minutes. Pause between blending if your blender needs a minute or two to cool down.</li>
          <li>Add any liquid flavourings (like maple syrup and vanilla extract) if using, and blend for another minute. If not using extra flavourings, skip this step unless the mixture is not completely smooth.</li>
          <li>If using cashews: taste the cashew/water mixture and adjust your flavourings if desired. Add the pinch of salt. Once you are happy with the taste, pour the milk into a large glass or plastic bottle, and store in the refrigerator.</li>
          <li>If using almonds: taste the almond/water mixture and adjust your flavourings if desired (ignore the grainy almond bits in the milk). Once you are happy with the taste, pour the milk through your nut milk bag, colander, cheesecloth or sieve, into a large glass or plastic bottle. The almond pulp will accumulate in your straining equipment. If using a nut milk bag or cheesecloth, gently squeeze the bag or cloth so that the remainder of the milk is separated from the pulp. If using a colander or sieve, use the back of a spoon to gently push down on the pulp, to extract the rest of the milk. Add the pinch of salt, stir, and store the milk in the refrigerator. Keep the pulp aside to add to smoothies, baking or granola, or stir into a bowl of oatmeal.</li>
          <li>Enjoy! The milk will keep in the fridge for about 5 days, and you will need to shake or stir the milk before serving.</li>

          <li>Heat the mixture in the saucepan over medium-high heat for a few minutes, until it begins to bubble. Reduce the heat to medium.</li>
          <li>Add 1 tsp of the calcium water to the mashed fruit and stir well. The remaining calcium water can be stored in your refrigerator for a future use.</li>
          <li>Continue to cook the fruit until some of the water has cooked off and the mixture has begun to thicken, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add the maple syrup and 1 tsp of the pectin powder, and stir very well until the powder has dissolved.</li>
          <li>Cook for another 1-2 minutes, adjusting the sweetness to your taste.</li>
          <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat, and allow the mixture to cool slightly. Pour it into a few small jars and allow it to cool fully.</li>
          <li>Seal the jars and place them in your freezer, and defrost one whenever you want to enjoy your homemade jam. The jam will keep well in the freezer for a year.</li>
