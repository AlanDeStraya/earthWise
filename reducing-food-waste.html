    <h3>Reducing Food Waste</h3>
    <div class='pseudo-img'></div>
    <h4>The High Cost of Food Waste</h4>
    <p>Food waste is a huge issue globally. <a href='http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data)' target='_blank'>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,</a> roughly one third of all food produced worldwide for human consumption is lost or wasted every year. This amounts to a staggering 1.3 billion tonnes of food, valued at approximately US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries.</p>
    <p>Aside from the obvious problems with this massive waste, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/07/31/food-waste/' target='_blank'>it has a significant environmental impact.</a> Food waste is estimated to contribute 8% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. This means that if food waste were a country, it would be the third largest in the world in terms of its impact on global warming, surpassed only by the United States and China.</p>
    <p>Within Canada, the <a href='https://globalnews.ca/news/4857582/canada-food-waste-study-2019/' target='_blank'>most recent study to examine food waste</a> found that more than half the food produced nationally is wasted. According to the report, “the value of usable groceries that wind up in landfills or other disposal sites is almost $50 billion. That’s more than half the amount Canadians spend on food every year and is enough to feed every Canadian for five months.” This is tragic, given that four million people in Canada struggle for regular meals. Alarmingly, the study’s authors say this estimate is conservative.</p>
    <p>Apparently, food waste happens everywhere along the supply chain, but to differing degrees:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Processing and manufacturing are the largest sources of avoidable waste, accounting for 43%</li>
      <li>Canadian kitchens are responsible for 21% of avoidable waste (about $1,700 per household)</li>
      <li>Hospitals, restaurants and institutions contribute 13% of avoidable food waste</li>
      <li>Retail outlets are similarly responsible at 12% of avoidable food waste</li>
      <li>Farmers waste 6% per cent of the usable food they produce</li>
      <li>Distributors had the lowest proportion of waste, at 5% of avoidable food waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly, we could all benefit from better food management systems to reduce losses at each step. Read on for tips and tricks for reducing day-to-day food waste.</p>
    <h4>Reducing Food waste</h4>
    <p>Unless you work in the food industry, the biggest opportunities you have to tackle food waste are probably within your own home. To that end, the tips below focus on addressing food waste at the household level.</p>
    <p>To a lesser extent, individual consumers may be able to help reduce waste at institutions, restaurants and retail outlets through conscientious shopping habits and voicing concerns to management. I certainly encourage this, and believe that the most successful approach is to ultimately address the issue from all sides.</p>
    <h5>Tip 1: Be your own kitchen manager</h5>
    <p>It’s very easy to lose track of what is already in your kitchen, and to forget to use things up before they spoil. The best way to avoid this is to get into the habit of regularly going through your fridge, freezer and pantry to ensure things are consumed while they are still good.</p>
    <p>Given that things in the fridge will typically spoil first, followed by frozen items and then pantry items, I suggest the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the fresh items in your fridge twice per week, and things like sauces, condiments and spreads once per month. Re-arrange the contents so the oldest items are at the front, and then immediately use anything that is nearing expiry and make a note to use up things that need to be consumed in the next 3-4 days. If you know you can’t use something before it will spoil, freeze it, give it away, or invite someone over to enjoy it with you.</li>
      <li>Review the contents of your freezer once per month to remind yourself of what is inside. Use this knowledge to plan to use up things that need to be eaten soon, and to avoid buying duplicates of things you already have while shopping. Put things that should be used up soon near the front. </li>
      <li>Go through your entire pantry once every 4-6 weeks, again to remind yourself of what you have, to plan to use up things nearing their best before date, and to easily remember what you already have when planning meals or grocery shopping. Items nearing expiry should be easily visible, so you remember to use them next time you reach for a non-perishable good.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Adding this regular check into your weekly or monthly routine will only take a few extra minutes, and it will save you in the long-run: you will reduce the amount of food and money you lose, save time dealing with foods that have gone bad, and prevent the stress and guilt that come with letting things go to waste. </p>
    <h5>Tip 2: Keep an inventory</h5>
    <p>Just as it is a good idea to regularly review what you have in stock, it can be helpful to keep an actual inventory of the items in your kitchen. It will take some time to set up initially, but will simplify the task of physically going through your fridge, freezer and pantry. Create a list of things you have in each location, and either keep a digital copy somewhere handy, like on your smartphone, or a hard copy somewhere easily accessible, like the front of your refrigerator.</p>
    <p>If you know an item’s best before date, including that on your inventory will make it easily to identify things that need to be consumed soon, and reduce the chances of something going to waste. Just be sure to cross off items when you use them, and to add new items to the list when you bring them home.</p>
    <h5>Tip 3: Plan ahead</h5>
    <p>If you are not generally someone who plans ahead, then the idea of pre-planning your meals, menus and shopping lists may seem foreign to you. However, many people find it simplifies their shopping and cooking routine, saves time overall, and reduces waste. Depending on how much you like to plan ahead, you can plan some or all of your meals for a week or a month at a time.</p>
    <p>For me, meal planning has a lot of benefits: it simplifies grocery shopping, saves me from deliberating what to eat on a daily basis, helps me to plan days that are relatively nutritionally balanced, and prevents me from forgetting to use things I already have. I like to plan out my meals one week at a time, knowing that I can change things if needed but that I have an outline to follow. Some people prefer to plan their meals for an entire month, which offers the same benefits and means you only have to actually create a meal plan once every 4 to 5 weeks.</p>
    <p>Once you have a meal plan, it becomes easy to create a shopping list. I like to look up the recipes I plan to use that week and copy the ingredients onto an app like Google Keep or a scrap piece of paper, which I can easily bring with me to the grocery store. Not only does this save me time at the grocery store, but it also means I’m less tempted to make spontaneous (usually unhealthy) purchases.</p>
    <p>If you decide to forgo meal planning, I still highly recommend making a list before going grocery shopping. While in a store, it can be easy to lose sight of what you will realistically eat before things spoil or before you go shopping again, and seeing a list of what you plan to buy can help you to keep your shopping in check. Grocery stores are laid out to encourage you to buy more than you need, so going in with a plan will reduce the likelihood of you over-shopping.</p>
    <p>One additional benefit of having a shopping list is that it can become your inventory list once you get home. Simply add the items to your soft or hard copy list, with the best before dates if possible, and use that as a reminder of what you have on hand!</p>
    <h5>Tip 4: Learn to love (or reduce) leftovers</h5>
    <p>In my experience, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who embrace leftovers, and those who despise them. I fall firmly into the first camp, and will happily eat the same thing for 5 days in a row. Not everyone is like this though, and knowing how likely you are to actually consume food leftover from a meal is helpful in keeping waste down.</p>
    <p>For leftover lovers: the best way to reduce the risk of leftover food being forgotten is to incorporate it into your meal planning. Whether you deliberately plan to cook a dish that serves 6 and know that you will have 4 portions leftover, or you are left with half of a serving of something that simply wasn’t finished at a meal, take a minute to decide ahead of time how that food will be used. Will it be dinner for the following two nights, or perhaps be added to someone’s breakfast or lunch the next day? Don’t assume that you will remember to use it without a plan, unless you are already in the habit of regularly checking for, and using up, leftover food.</p>
    <p>If you aren’t a fan of leftovers, do your best to match what you prepare with what you need. If you often find yourself tossing partial or full portions of a meal that weren’t consumed, it’s time to scale back how much you make. Take a little bit of extra time during your meal prep to really think about what is likely to be eaten, and soon the practice of preparing smaller portions that are easily finished at mealtime will be part of your routine.</p>
    <p>No matter which camp you fall into, there are two things you can do to avoid leftovers from being tossed out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Freeze it. Anytime I have something that I know I won’t be able to finish before it spoils, I will freeze it. Too much fresh spinach, kale, or fruit for my smoothies? I wash, chop and freeze everything in Tupperware or reusable baggies. Bought too much bread, ordered too much pizza, or made too much of a soup, stew or curry? Freeze it in a container, jar or bag. Almost anything can be frozen, either in its original state (like chopped up onions and tomatoes, frozen and ready to be pulled out for a curry) or once it has been made into something (like overripe bananas turned into banana bread, then frozen).</li>
      <li>Get creative. When you have a lot of random ingredients leftover in your fridge, it may take a bit of effort to think about how to use them, but it can be fun. I will sometimes make a giant salad or bowl, or a pot of soup, to use up several different items that need to be eaten. There are apps and websites that can help with this, by letting you search for recipes based on ingredients you already have at home. Try <a href='https://www.supercook.com/#/recipes' target='_blank'>SuperCook,</a> <a href='http://www.foodwise.com.au/recipe-room/our-recipe-finder/' target='_blank'>FoodWise</a> or <a href='https://recipeland.com/recipes/by_ingredient' target='_blank'>RecipeLand</a> to get started.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Tip 5: Test before you toss</h5>
    <p>There are some major misconceptions related to expiry and best before dates, so allow me to start by clearing that up:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <em>expiration date</em> is the date by which something is expected to spoil, and is generally the last day a product is safe to consume.</li>
      <li>A <em>best before date</em> is simply the approximate time at which a food’s quality will start to decline. It may lose some of its freshness, taste, aroma, texture or nutrients, but is very possibly still safe to eat.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these dates are good guidelines, they are not the most reliable way to tell if a food has gone bad. Just as an item can become unsafe to eat before its best before or expiry date, due to something like poor storage or a manufacturing defect, food can also be okay to eat after the date on its label. Your judgement is generally far more reliable than what is written on a package, especially since the most common dates we see are best before dates, and not at all related to food safety.</p>
    <p>Use your senses – taste, smell and touch – to determine if a food is still okay to eat, rather than simply tossing it solely because it has passed its date. And if you are someone who prefers to eat food at its freshest, a well-managed kitchen and food inventory should ensure that you do not have to consume food that is past its peak.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you do have to dispose of something that is past its prime, be sure to compost the food so that it does not end up in a landfill. Many municipalities now collect organic waste, but if yours does not you can either compost at home or ask a friendly neighbour or local organization, like a community garden, to do it for you.</p>
    <h5>Tip 6: Make use of food scraps</h5>
    <p>If you’re looking to further reduce your waste, try these hacks to get even more out of your foods, before they go into the compost:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use old teabags for cleaning (they cut through grease very well), personal care (they rehydrate your skin and reduce under-eye circles), and eliminate odours (green tea leaves or bags in particular can replace baking soda in your refrigerator).</li>
      <li>Put used coffee grounds in DIY face and hand washes to make them more exfoliating, add them to soil to make your own fertilizer, or use to eliminate odours in your fridge or on your hands.</li>
      <li>Use vegetable scraps to make a homemade vegetable stock, great for soups, stews and sauces. <a href='https://ohmyveggies.com/how-to-make-vegetable-broth-with-kitchen-scraps/' target='_blank'>This recipe</a> goes into more detail, but essentially you can collect vegetable scraps in a bag or container in your freezer until you have a few cups’ worth, and then boil them with water and some garlic, a bit of olive oil, herbs and spices. Note that onions, celery and carrots usually form the basis of most stocks or broths, and that cruciferous vegetables are not a good fit because they can give the stock a bitter taste.</li>
      <li>Regrow certain vegetables at home, with just the root and some water. Onions, lettuce, garlic, herbs and potatoes  can all be regrown at home. See <a href='https://about.spud.com/blog-regrowing-vegetables-from-scrap/' target='_blank'>this site</a> for more info.</li>
